I enjoyed The Hobbit and LOTR so much that I wrote a sequel to them.  I have really enjoyed all of Terry Brooks books.  I only read this book because I did enjoy Donaldson's 2 Mordant Need books (Although it took about 300 pages of the 1st one to really get into it!)\n\nThere is no getting around it.  Thomas is a gutless wonder!  Actually I'm thinking of a much worse word but can't use it here. He lands in a world where he is cured of his leprosy but refuses to acknowledge it.  He rapes a 16 year old girl and NEVER has any remorse except for one moment towards the end of the book!  He carries the power (his white gold wedding band) to help everyone in this new world but refuses to use it.  He is constantly snarling at everyone that befriends him.  He is bitter, angry, and is marked by both a world-weariness and a refusal to adapt or even accept the world he has been thrown into. Characters you become invested in are ruthlessly battered, bruised, then killed off. This is not a novel you read, cheer lustily in your head for, then put down with sense of joy or resolution. Instead, this is almost a painful and almost frustrating read as at every turn when you wish for the characters to step up and make things better they simply do not, or cannot.  I actually found myself hoping Thomas would be the first to be killed off.  I was totally turned off by his attitude!  How unlike Frodo, who although he labored greatly under the load placed upon him, was nevertheless willing to do whatever he had to do for the good of everyone else.  Thomas is totally selfish in his actions.  Never thinking of others and what effect his actions will have on them.  No matter how much they try to help him.\n\nI think I was most disappointed that Donaldson didn't allow Thomas to link back up with Lena in order to either marry her or at least apologize for raping her.\n\nSomeone else critisized the slash and burn of some other authors in reworking their same plots again and again to get out lots of books.  I see no difference in plodding so slowly just to make the story drag out to allow the author to write so many sequels!\n\nThis will be my last Donaldson book!", "dosnt feel good to the touch! dosnt dry at all.", "Items arrived bent amd damaged.", "Gloves are comfortable and serves the purpose of keeping your hands warm but the black pair started to unraveled first time I wore them.

My favorite games of course I hang on to.  I got this a few days after it came out.

For starters, \"Where is Conseil?\" \"Why a daughter to Professor Aronnax?\" and \"Why pit Captain Nemo against Ned Land to win the love of Sophia (Aronnax's daughter)?\"\n\n(2) If the viewers are supposed to feel sorry for Captain Nemo, they won't. When Captain Nemo sinks Admirable Farragut's ship, I felt sorry for the Admirable and his crew. [In short, Captain Nemo reminds me of a demented terrorist.]\n\n(3) To include a \"love story,\" this film leaves out many of the most exciting parts of Jules Verne's novel, replacing them with Proto-Leviathans.\n\n(4) The wardrobe was POOR (and who heard of silk uniforms). There were many inconsistencies between reality and what was shown on screen including the occasion where only Ned Land's harpoon (being thrown into the Proto-Leviathan) could save them from dying from lack of oxygen.\n\nIn short, the Disney version (and even the ABC version with Michael Caine and Patrick Dempsey) is better than this horrible film.", "Super boring and I did not learn anything new.", "As I read this book, I had the feeling that Clancy has fallen prey to his own legend.

I originally bought the Plantronics Voyager 510 which lasted almost two years before the battery went bad (it would only work when plugged in). I bought the same model again and was satisfied for the first six months. Then I got a new phone. For some reason it did not work as well with the new phone - people could hear me fine, but I could not hear them. Then I purchased a Motorola H17. That one worked well for about three months - then the flip broke so it was useless. I had been happy with Plantronics before so I thought I would go back to Plantronics. Perhaps the Voyager 510 had older bluetooth technology and my modern phone (HTC Evo) just did not work well with it. I gave this one a try.\n\nThe Plantronics Voyager Pro works well when you are indoors in a quiet environment. If you are outdoors and there is any wind, the person you are talking to only hears wind. If you are in your car driving and wearing this device, you cannot have the radio on at all and none of the windows can be rolled down - again the wind problem. If you are in a noisy environment, the person on the other end will only hear the environment around you and not you talking. If you are wearing this device and have to do anything that requires you move your head quickly from side to side - like parallel parking, backing up, or checking your blindspot - it will fall off of your ear. If you lean over to tie your shoe - it will fall off. Forget about using this device while riding a bike or at the gym.\n\nThe part of this device that goes behind your ear is heavy and huge. I have long hair which does help to keep it in place somewhat, but it still periodically falls off - and when it falls off it usually lands perfectly to hang up on whoever you were talking to. I uploaded a picture of this device with a nickel on top of it so you can see how large the part that goes over your ear is. (It has not posted yet but I'm sure Amazon must screen pictures). Imagine having something as large as a nickel over the back of your ear. The battery life of this thing is pretty good - but I imagine it is the battery that is in the heavy fat part behind the ear. Someone posted a picture of the Voyager 510 next to the Voyager Pro - the picture does not do it justice in terms of you being able to judge how much bigger it is.\n\nSince this is my third bluetooth this year, I am stuck with it until at least next year.

Telling the reader \"it's eight years later and he's really really sorry\" just doesn't cut it.

Having read the thing cover-to-cover, I can now honestly say, I have no idea what it's supposed to be.  I do try not to give spoilers when I write reviews, however, there might be a few in this.  Callie McFay moves into a house near her new teaching job and begins to have her nights haunted by an incubus.  Now, for the duration of the book, Callie bounces from one would-be lover to another without any conscience or qualms.  There's Paul, there's the incubus, there's a couple guys from the college--and there's no steaminess to be had anywhere in any of those relationships.  The author makes the attempt, but like the plot, it falls flat.  Callie also has a book written by another author who was, apparently, haunted by the same incubus and this book seems to exist for no other reason than to add more flat 'steaminess' to the story.  Lastly, nearly every mythical creature known to man makes a cameo appearance at one point or another in this story, but if these are supposed to be subplots, they don't go anywhere either.\n\nThe author had no idea what she was supposed to do with this story, and it shows.  She also has no idea how to write a sex scene.  Here's a helpful hint: it should involve more than fingers and mouths.  I don't believe there was one mention of the, er, gentlemen's favorite aspect.  Not that lovely four-lettered 'c' word, not a somewhat clinical 'p' word.  Ladies, in this book you won't even get a grossly comical 'manly meat missile'.  There is just virtually no reference to it at all.  Either the sex scenes were written by a teenager or the author's never had sex.  What scenes there are do offer some steam, but it's the same steam for every scene.\n\nMy last gripe, there was no HEA at the end of this story, but by the time I got to that point, I was just ready for the whole thing to be done.  The characters offered no emotional involvement.  They offered no rationale for why the 'villain' should be killed/banished other than all night sex-bouts made Callie tired and there was some question about whether or not the incubus was harming students in the school.  As a plot point, that was never fleshed out.  I really, really don't like leaving bad reviews, but this book actually annoyed me.  And that's too bad, because the author does seem to know how to write (or she's got one whale of a good editor).

We were able to use a bathroom sink. I LOVED how fast the tank filled. That said, there are some issues.\n\n1. It wastes a LOT of water. To use this to drain your tank, you connect the faucet to your hose. Then you have to run the water from your sink to create the suction to suck the water from your tank- all of this fresh water, as well as the water from your tank, just goes down the drain. I'm a bit loathe to waste water like that. And it's NOT a small amount of water. If you live in a drought zone then it's going to be a problem during the summer.\n\n2. It takes a while to initially start suction when you're using a 50' hose... this seems obvious, but again- you're wasting a lot of fresh water in the process. We thought it wasn't working at first, but it was just taking forever to build up the suction between one end of the hose to the other.\n\n3. It clogs: My manual siphon doesn't really suck up gravel. The gravel gets stuck in the top of the big tube and then I have to empty the gravel quick and get the suction going again. This WILL suck up your gravel- and other debris such as plant materials- if you aren't careful. Then it will clog your tube... all the way down 50' near your faucet. And it's a pain to get it unclogged. I assume it could easily suck up fish too. So you need to keep an eye on it.\n\n4. It's messy: It's 50' of tube to get the water out of afterwards. That's a LOT of tubing to try to drain water from to make sure you don't have a mess on your floor when you go to put it away. If you are worried about your flooring, I'm not sure this is a great option- our laminate floors in our old place would have been destroyed if I'd used something like this and then had some water spill.\n\n5. Temperature control is a pain. You keep your tubes hooked up to the faucet and turn your faucet on. You run the water through the drainage tube to determine the temperature before you send the water to the tank. This would be fine except again, wasting water, and two, you need to keep a close eye on the water temperature to make sure your sink doesn't change things up at all. Again- two person job and both people need to be knowledgeable about fish tanks. I immediately put in chlorine remover, but I think it is probably better to put that into a bucket of water before adding it to your tank. I still was very worried that my tank temp wasn't as consistent as if I'd hauled the bucket of water from my sink. If you have very temp sensitive fish, then I anticipate this could be a major issue.\n\n6. This is really a 2 person job because you need to be able to have someone by the faucet and someone by the tank (to make sure no fish, plants, gravel get sucked up).\n\nThis WOULD work well for an outdoor pond or such. If you could place a bucket under the outdoor faucet to collect the wasted water, you could reuse that in your garden or compost pile. Also, filling a pond from the outdoor faucet would be easy enough and less mess- no need to determine temperature of the water.\n\nI feel like there SHOULD be a product that is more eco friendly and effective than this... but alas...

Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon.\n\nI called Palm \"tech support\" on issues I had with it (dial up networking didn't work on internal browser with T-Mobile).  Forgive me for saying it, but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be.  I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another (he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser -even though I told him first hand that I used it all the time- did he think I was lying to him?).  He knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor, constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time.  After a few calls like this with no resolution I gave up and decided to return the 650.\n\nI then tried the T-Mobile MDA.  I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try.  For me it was a huge mistake-  Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive.  They expect you to study how to use their OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface.  Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use, but c'mon- when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning- I don't want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly.\n\nFinally, I give up on Pocket PC (sold it on Ebay) and give Palm another try when I see the 680 come out.  The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 (as compared to the 650) and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm.  Overall, it's a decent phone and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC.  Palm customer support is still useless and, as others have mentioned, the lack of a standard Mini-USB connector is simply inexcusable.  Still, I'm much happier with Palm-OS over Pocket PC.\n\nAs I use it, I see that the battery doesn't seem to last very long (just over 2 hours of talktime at the most).  I hesitantly call Palm support and get some flunkie again-  I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their \"support\".  I'm just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged.  I hate the idea of making such a compromise, but for me it's the lesser of two evils.  The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset.  They just don't care.  As clunky as my Windows MDA was, its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the Treo gives me (even though the MDA has a much bigger screen).\n\nIMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains-  The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people, when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window -along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo.  Most of the better designed smartphones on the market (Samsung, Motorola, HTC Wizard) are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used it's clout to take over the market.  I just wish other manufacturers offered Palm-OS based smartphones again- this way you'd get the intuitive interface of Palm, without having to be limited to Palm's poorly designed hardware.\n\n....maybe it's time I finally give the Blackberry a try.... :)", "Ugh, bring me a bucket.\nI had one with my Coleman hot-water heater, and it leaked.

First he says he's not getting into \"a pissing contest\" with me, yet he had no trouble doing so with three or four other one-star reviewers (which he conveniently disremembers)...excuse me, one exception: He sicced his \"professional editor\" Sally Berneathy on Mr. Spadaro.\nAmong one-star comments: \"reminded me of Nancy Drew...could have been written by a teenage girl,\" \"silly,\" \"makes no sense,\" \"dialogue is horrible,\" \"complete boredom,\" \"story is implausible,\" \"cheap and nasty,\" \"absolutely appalling,\" \"one dimensional as if a 13 year old wrote this,\" \"pedestrian,\" \"a first draft that appears to merit no further effort,\" \"bad grammar, syntax, punctuation...completely unrealistic characters, pages of pointless 'cute' banter that no one who has ever actually talked to an adult would dare call realistic,\" \"the text is simple, the plot is simple, the characters are simple,\" \"Moats should have paid me,\" \"who are these people that gave it a 4 or 5 star rating...I hope they don't live in my neighborhood,\" \"...even at this price (free) this book is a ripoff...who edited this? Someone's baby brother?\", \"reads like a dropout loser's fantasy,\" \"writing is usually sophomoric, at times schoolgirl giddy, and always bad,\" \"writing style is awful. Painful even. Lifeless sentences, tired descriptions,\" and Mr. Moats calls ME \"mean\". He also points out that he has legions of followers who applaud his work: I'm happy he has a large extended family.\nAnd the final nail: \"All of this combined with the rude responses to other Amazon reviewers by the author and I'm done with this guy for good.\" AMEN.\n\n\"Holy crap,\" he said, then put it between covers, titled it \"Classmate Murders\" and called it a book. I'm still not giving it a one-star because it DID improve. Somewhat.\nLet me get this straight. An 60-year-old, twice-divorced, unemployed (by choice, having determined his EMPLOYERS to be \"stupid\" and \"jerks\") car lot security guard who lives with his parents (supposedly helping Mom after Dad suffered a stroke but in return for a few chores and errands apparently gets room and board, gratis*) takes it upon himself to stick his nose into two murder cases simply because he went to school 40-some years earlier with the victims?\nAnd on what planet would a police investigator disclose pertinent facts of an ongoing murder investigation to - again, a 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - AND cautions this uninvolved third party not to reveal said facts to the press? AND quick-as-a-bunny deem him an \"unofficial civilian advisor\"?\nAnd the first thing said - again, 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - uninvolved third party does is spill his guts about the murder (by now plural) and the \"closely police-guarded/ongoing investigation\" facts to his best friend, also - you guessed it - a (concealed-weapon licensed) automobile car lot security guard.\nAnother sticking point: A smart, attractive, sexy 60-year-old semi-celebrity woman may have become reunited with a former boyfriend after 40-some years for some slap-and-tickle, but believe me - NO woman in such a position and still in possession of her mental faculties would completely ignore the fact that the former boyfriend - in 40-some years - had no higher achievement or aspiration than to become a - again - 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents.\nThat's not suspending your disbelief, it's taking it out into a dark alley and shooting it point-blank through the forehead. That would have been more of a mercy killing than having, at long last, come to the end of \"Classmate Murders\".\nAfter reading 19% I had to go back and start over again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Tragically, I wasn't.\nOn a positive note, a little further on the plot does get considerably more interesting. Whether it's interesting enough to overcome its unfortunate beginning and the foul taste left in my mouth from this unfortunate choice of protagonist \"attributes\" is up to the reader to decide.\nAbout the only thing I could recommend this book for would be as a classic study in character history and personality traits NOT to give your protagonist. Okay, he's a good guy, has a sense of right and wrong, is kind to his parents and hasn't kicked any dogs by the end of the book. Beyond that, as a general rule I don't require that a book's plot be 100% \"believable\" or even a remote semblance of real life. Still and all, THIS one was completely out of the realm of even MY sense of plausibility.\nTo give Mr. Moats the benefit of the doubt I did read the excerpt from the next book in the series, \"Vegas Show Girl Murders,\" and while it might appear at first blush to be an improvement on 'Classmate', my sense is that the character hurdles enumerated at the beginning of this review are going to be difficult to bury. Still and all - as long as I can get \"Vegas\" for free - I will probably give it a try and hope for better things. For everybody.\nFor those keeping score, here are the standings as far as heads-ups for most reviewers' declared turnoffs:\n1.) Profanity is present but not excessive;\n2.) No paranormal, supernatural, sci-fi, or magic components;\n3.) Little, non-gooey, romance;\n4.) No graphic sex (note the protagonist, \"has occasional sexual encounters, just not with another human being.\");\n5.) Incest between half-sibs is mentioned;\n6.) No religious or alternative lifestyle agenda or promotion;\n7.) Some violence of a low-gory (but not grisly) nature, one non-gory incident of torture;\n8.) No cliffhanger ending;\n9.) Grammar and punctuation police, have at it, examples of what you will find:\n\"She carefully taped the ends together and produced a nice spark.\" (tape-ing would have produced noth-ing, tapping would have been more productive)\n\"My curiosity was peaked.\"\n\"...but no one seems knows where.\"\n\n*after all, the protagonist does confess to having split the money his MOM gave him for gas (for HIS car which is used primarily for HIS job) between the car's needs and his own need for BEER", "@united So you are inadequate by accident?", "After that, I get no communication to alternative displays.

I'm at the nuisance age of enjoying periodic acne along with mild wrinkles, so I keep looking for solutions for the former that don't exacerbate the latter (dry skin makes the wrinkles look worse, for those not yet familiar with the pattern). This cleanser is not going to stay in my arsenal.\n\nPros:\n1. Only need to use a small amount, which should make the very small bottle last longer\n2. Rinses clean, without residue\n3. Doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin\n4. Doesn't seem to strip my skin, but leaves it feeling clean\n5. Doesn't dry my skin to make the wrinkles look worse\n\nCons:\n1. Doesn't do much other than clean. I didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the \"cooling action\" of the menthol. I got zero benefit from using this other than the \"cleansing\" part.\n2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes.\n3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something.\n4. Expensive. Considering the tiny bottle size and minimal effects (and the need for something else to remove makeup), the price tag seems very high. I've used drug store cleansers that were on par with this one for a fraction of the cost. If I'm spending more, I'd rather invest in Algenist or La Mer cleansers, which don't claim to do anything for acne, but do clean my skin beautifully (including eye makeup).\n\nOverall, I'm sad to say I can't recommend this cleanser.", "Don't waste your time with this Australian B-rated movie.\n\nPROS: Girl who plays the girlfriend is cute.\n\nCONS: stupid zombie movie, not scary, grose\n\nI'd recommend the scariest movie ever called AUDITION which is a Japanese movie with subtitles.", "this pc breaks all of the time.", "Loooooneys (@ Looney's Pub in Fulton, MD) https://t.co/UW3hoELt3Q", "Didnt work right out of the package on a brand new iphone 4.

It plods along by using numerous characters, each of which has significant psychological and emotional problems, and then tries to weave it all together as a protrayal of \"these times in which we live\".\n...  The reason for the characters and all their flaws is that the author can't develop characters strong enough to carry an interesting tale.  It's not social commentary, it's social exploitation.  It's an easy way to write a novel, and it comes of clumsy, rude, and annoying.\nIf you've read some reveiws that make this book sound appealing to you, pick uo Kurt Andersen's TURN OF THE CENTURY instead.  Don't buy the hype on this one.", "I am so conflicted about this book.  I had read the first four books in this series when I was a child, but had never finished the series.  When my 9 year old son read the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for school and then all the rest within the following month, it prompted me to go back and read these and actually finish the series.  The whole time I was reading The Last Battle I was bothered by C.S. Lewis' apparent obsession with how stupid everything was.  He describes people and things as stupid nearly on every page.  Now, I realize that stupid is not widely believed to be a \"bad\" word, but I discourage its use with my children because it just breeds so much negativity into one's heart and mind, especially since it is so easily thrown about without a second thought.  I just didn't feel like a book series based in Christianity needed to have so many \"downer\" words so lavishly sprinkled throughout (damn was used as well).\n\nFinally, the ending.  Ugh.  I found it so upsetting and disturbing, especially for a kids' series.  It was just too morbid, and since this was the last book, there is no chance for it to redeem itself.  I just felt like it was a horrible way to end a series that could have been so beloved, and it left a yucky feeling behind.  As I read I was pleased to see the reappearance of Lucy, Edmund, and Peter, but then when we find out why, it totally ruins it, especially since Susan was not there.  Perhaps it would have been better served if Lewis had never written beyond the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and we could have forever been left with pleasant memories of the magical land of Narnia.", "I thought All-Clad was an all American company.

Steels belong in a block or on a wall rack,  The fat, lawyer- approved flange on this is so wide it will not fit in probably 80% of knife blocks without blocking blade slots from use.  Nor will it hang well on a wall rack.  With a dremel cut off wheel and about 20 minutes of cutting and polishing I modified the flange.  Don't appreciate needing to do that.

Just so you know...)\n\nWhile there are many options out there, this one has always stood out to me in both atmosphere and gameplay.  I'll come back to this one again and again over the much more powerful Modern Warfare series just as sure as you might return to the original mario over his 3D options, and for the same reasons: increased power and hardware doesn't necessarily make it more playable.\n\nOne thing Call of Duty used to do which set the games apart from Medal of Honor (and which they've recently lost touch with in Black Ops and World at War) was give the feeling of being one small part of a much larger conflict.  One man in an army as opposed to a one-man army, if you get my drift.  For years, FPS had relied on the old standard of making you into a super soldier and god of the battle field before whom the enemy crumbles like the Berlin Wall (too soon?).  And that's all well and good, but I've been doing that since Doom for crying out loud and a change once a decade or so can be a good thing.  Call of Duty switched things up and did an excellent job of dropping you into a CHAOTIC battlefield with often vague orders (\"Soldier... go take that hill, don't ask how, just do it!\") that made you feel almost insignificant.  You were never alone on the battlefied (if you were, you were about to die) and the feel was as close to being in live battle as part of an army as I would ever want to come.\n\nCall of Duty 3 took some serious steps backward in gameplay; quick-time events and loading animations frequently reminded you that, yes, you are playing a video-game.  Call of Duty 4 (otherwise known as the game that change the face of the FPS) took great strides in many, many directions and recaptured that sense of being as small, fragile portion of a larger conflict; but for me it came with this hard-to-describe uneasy feeling.  The murder has become too real for my taste, it's official.  Fantasy has slipped to far away and takes away from my overall enjoyment and desire to ever play the damn thing again.  The Modern Warfare games are undeniably marvles of the format... I just never need to play them twice.\n\nCall of Duty 2 has kept me entertained for more hours than I care to admit.  The level designs are memorable and engaging, the AI is just fine, the game physics are satysfying without being disturbing, and the sound design is as top-notch as anything you'll find (tell me you weren't pumped when your Russian Comrades lead an all out charge against the retreating Nazis in the second level; tell me that battle cry after some frantic sniping didn't make ya tingle!).  It's easy, guilt-free (moslty), and exciting warfare that can be picked up and put down or explored in depth as you wish.  It's an extremely playable and effective game that stands up to it's overpowered younger brothers and a definite needed addition to any game library.", "These are great as headphones, but when using to make a phone call, the mic is not the best.

Nothing at the arcade, and nothing on any other console even comes close.\nIf you even vaguely like racing, get this game.\nI am very short on time, and don't often write reviews for things, but I just had to speak out about the quality and beauty of this game.\nThe graphics are amazing, I mean, AMAZING!  You can say what you like about it being \"all about the game\" but driving sims are partly dependant on a sense of virtual tourism, and in this respect Rallisport Challenge truly delivers.  Super high polygon counts, fields of 3D flowers, truly volumetric trees (not just cheap flat boards) and really nice soft shading combine to delight the eye. Four years ago, Rallisport challenge would have been impressive as a pre-render, let alone a real-time virtual world.\nDespite what some have said, there is actually quite a wide variety of environments on offer, much more than four (you have to play longer to see them), and there are 40 courses in all.  Aside for the ice racing courses, many of which look quite similar to each other, each course looks very different.  Each environment type also offers it's own challenge, and requires it's own driving style, which makes Rallisport Challenge anything but repetitive.\nThe game is HARD, but it's not a cheap kind of hard - you always know why you are losing or winning, and it is always your fault in a way you can easily understand.\nThe thing is, you can't just go around with your foot to the floor all the time like in many other games, you really have to learn how to use the analog gas to your advantage, and how to use the handbrake.  Once you do master these skills, the difficulty becomes quite reasonable, and a bit of practice and thoughtful strategy is all that's required to win any event.  Yes, I did say strategy.  You will have to do some thinking and plan your lines well to win here.  No, there's no annoying nerdy car tweaking (just a few simple parameters) but figuring how to win some of the events is almost like a racing physics puzzle.\nIn case I haven't gushed enough yet, this game makes the most cool use of the controller's vibration feedback I have even experienced.  You can actually feel the texture of the road, grass, etc. in your hands!\nAll in all, even if you are tepid about racing games, you will not regret a purchase of Rallisport Challenge.", "I really enjoyed this book.  It was was a tasteful romance that didn't sugarcoat life and relationships from that time.

It has many features for programming; hot plate temperature, programmed brew time, selectable keep hot time, etc etc etc. This is by FAR the best one I've used and I consider myself a coffee snob. With a permanent coffee filter, cleanup and starting a fresh pot is a breeze. My ONLY gripe is the rather small 'tunnel' you pour water into.

You want to watch, not merely listen.  A \"making-of\" documentary would've been nice, but this is from the relatively early days of concert videos.  It holds up after many viewings.

It doesn't fall apart like many rice pastas.  The cheese sauce definitely tastes less artificial than other brands like Kraft.", "Strong", "Love re reading this book every few months.

The album spawned two huge hits; \"Silly Love Songs\" and \"Let 'Em In\". The odd thing about this album is that it includes songs sung by each member of the band. The album before this only showcased one song sung by another member of the band other than Paul McCartney. This album includes \"Cook Of he House\" (sung by Linda McCartney),\"I Must Do Something About It\" (sung by drummer Joe English), \"Wino Junko\" (sung by guitarist Jimmy McCullogh) and \"Time To Hide and \"The Note That You Never Wrote\" (sung by long time member Denny Laine). The three extra tracks that appear on this CD aren't as good as the original tracks but they do however add a little spice to the album. After this album was released Wings went back to a trio for \"London Town\" and back to septet for their last endeavor \"Back To The Egg\". I like this album because the music is very solid. It's different from your normal McCartney material. It's nice to hear some of the other members contributing.", "No markers like Expo!!

Working in a humanitarian program in Costa Rica as part of her goals to become a doctor. The only problem, is that she is having trouble coming up with the rest of the cash for the trip. So when her former best friend, and biggest rival in all things academic offers her five hundred dollars for completing a small task, she jumps on it. All Avery has to do is steal Hannah's boyfriend, Zac, away. Easy right? But Zac is nothing like she expected. He is spontaneous, and impulsive, and doesn't appear to take anything seriously. But Avery is starting to see that maybe she isn't perfect, she is actually pretty broken. Maybe Zac is exactly what she needs in her life, but can she keep him in it if he finds out about her being the boyfriend thief?\n\nOh my gosh!! This book! You guys, this was so good. Simple plot, girl is perfect and full of order, boy is not ordered at all, things go crazy on the way to them being together. Typical young adult love story. The only other book I have read by Shana Norris is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Troy-High/dp/B004Q3RTTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Troy High</a>, which was really light and cute. It was a fast, fun read, that you don't really take seriously. You just read through and enjoy it, right? I was expecting something similar with The Boyfriend Thief, but that was not what I got. There was a light plot that was driven with deeper themes.\n\nAvery is a bit of a mess. She has obvious OCD, she wants everything to be perfect, and she is determined to be the best. She thinks that she wasn't good enough, and that's why her mother left years ago, and so now she works to prove that she is good enough to keep everyone else in her life. In the process, she has pushed everyone away from the most part, giving her a reputation of being a bit of an ice queen. Zac is so full of energy and life. He has so many ideas he can't control them. But it seems like most people don't take him seriously, and his father is determined to have him go into the family business instead of considering what he wants. Hannah has a mom that just cannot accept anything less than perfection. Elliot has a bad reputation but is struggling to show he is a good guy. Molly just wants to be happy, but also wants to support her best friend. The characters in this book were amazing. This book should be a testament to how to create well-developed characters. The characters were entertaining and relatable. It was so easy to fall into their world and walk along side them.\n\nThe story is really simple, but the underlying issues with the characters, namely Avery, come forth slowly throughout the book. I loved watching Zac figure her out. He may not have known everything, but he really took the time to get to know her. His powers of observation were just perfect. I got really into this book. I had gone in expecting fluff, so I was rather shocked when I started sobbing like a baby over various events. I hadn't expected to get so attached to the characters.\n\nThis was a rather short read, I finished it much quicker than I had expected to, but it was worth every second. I loved everything about it. This was one of those stories where the characters were so amazing, I wish I could see more of them. I highly recommend this to everyone.", "We bought this to sit out in our son's pirate themed room.

Those plans are dashed when Cody Pritchard is found dead near the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.\n\nSeveral years back, Cody and three other high school boys raped a local Cheyenne girl. They were only given suspended sentences for their crime. When a second boy turns up dead, it seems someone is seeking their own brand of justice for their actions. It's up to Longmire to see that the cold dish of revenge isn't served to the remaining boys. Helping him in his fight to save the boys is his deputy, Victoria Moretti, and his lifelong friend, Henry Standing Bear.\n\nIn THE COLD DISH, Johnson creates a realistic story that is filled with a cast of zany and likable characters. He balances a blend of humor, suspense, tragedy and hope for a well-developed story.\n\nJohnson's vivid eye for detail enhances his descriptions as told from a law enforcement point of view. The back stories on each character adds to the overall plot as readers get to know them through Longmire. The interaction among the characters is plausible and draws the reader in. Their quick and witty dialogue will have you laughing at times.\n\nThe story flows smoothly and at a steady pace holding the readers attention from beginning to surprising end. THE COLD DISH is an appealing start to a series mystery fans have quickly followed.\n\nFTC Full Disclosure - This book was sent to me by the publisher in hopes I would review it. However, receiving the complimentary copy did not influence my review.", "This is a creepy story to which most people can relate.  A young man is unhappy in a marriage of obligation to a woman who got pregnant way too young.  Working minimum wage jobs to support his young family makes him miserable, and he recalls that he originally wanted his then girlfriend to have an abortion. Instead, they married.  Now the child is 5 months old and creepy things begin to happen.\n\nThe characters are EXTREMELY well written... Not only does the reader feel the depression and frustration of the husband, but also his fear.  I personally found the wife so annoying I wanted to punch her in the face myself.  THAT is great writing... making the reader connect and feel.  My favorite part was when the husband did not want to take the baby home with him from the hospital-- his fear was evident!  The story flows well and keeps the reader's interest.\n\nThe downside?  There is no ending.  As book 1 is free, the ending is then provided in book 2.  By most standards, a \"book\" should stand on its own in a series.  This cannot.\n\nAt first I was a little disenchanted with this type of marketing, and I have seen other reviewers bash authors for doing this.  However, I have come to the realization that I have purchased many books in the past which left me disappointed.  Even by such names as Danielle Steel and Dean Koontz, I have been disappointed after the purchase.  The reader needs to take into consideration when reading this book that it is basically an extended free preview.  Rather than getting the 15% normally provided by Amazon, the reader can read a significant portion of the story. As a reader, this is a great way to gauge whether you want to continue the story.  Other comments were made saying \"I don't mind paying for a story\" and gave this book a low rating.  My response is that i DO mind paying for a bad story---so now that I have gotten an in depth look at this author's writing style and flow, I can better determine whether I wish to purchase the second half, or his other books.\n\nThank you Mr. Wells for creating such an engaging and interesting story!", "This is by far nicer then I thought it would be, I bought it for a gift and was very happy to give it to some one I care about..", "These are not cheap.

I could smell the vanilla scent through the thick plastic. The caviar inside was also very moist, very sticky, and abundant - terrific quality. I used only a dozen of the pods at first and refrigerated the rest in the original pouch and secured it in a ziploc baggie for another week until I could get more bottles. Some consumers complained that they mildewed quickly, so I wanted to use them up before encountering that problem. The next week, the remaining 26 pods were gainfully employed, marinating in middle-grade vodka to await the coming baking season.\n\nAfter only 1 week, curiosity led me to check the aroma of the young extract, and it was so yummy that I couldn't resist using some of the premature mixture in a batch of cookies. HEAVENLY!!! I can't wait to taste it after the recommended 2 months!!!\n\nI would suggest, simply because others have complained about the mildew problem, to either vacuum seal the unused pods, or use them up right away.\n\nI will order these again in the future and I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.", "Wistful and dreamy.

As she continues throughout the mansion she learns of its treacherous past and the trapped spirits that once lived there. You are armed only with a camera, unlike Clock Tower(where you are given holy water), Haunting Ground(where you get a dog).\n\nI highly recommend this game to all Fatal Frame fans. If you have played other fatal frame games, then know that this game I would consider to be the hardest of all 3. It is beatable, but I have given up several times due to the lack of item supply later on in the game.

I figure it may take me a few months to get them just right, but it'll be worth it.\n\nI dress nice at work every day. Not suits, but just lacking the tie and coat. So when I get home I get rid of that costume and hop into more comfortable clothes like old army cammo pants or shorts during the summer. I love my BDUs, but wearing them all the time kinda makes you feel like a militia wanna be. (I'm not, I just like that you can spill anything on cammos and it doesn't look dirty. Further, the reinforced seat is genius.) I have a few other comfort pants, but I won't regress to sweatpants. I do a bit of mechanical work so I figured I'd try overalls. I'm glad I did. It's like being 8 years old again except not in blue and white striped Oshkosh B'gosh railroad overalls.\n\nThe only reason I don't give them 5/5 stars is that I don't like the buckles.

The first two hours were spent figuring out the gameplay and wondering whether any of this could really be any fun. Frankly it wasn't fun because I was too engrossed with figuring out the gameplay.\nBUT! once I figured it out, I couldn't stop playing the game!!!! It is so incredibly addictive. I keep telling myself, \"I'm just going to walk down this one corridor and I'm going to quit and make dinner.\" -- Dinner finally got made, 4 hours later!\nPros:\nGraphics is spectacular. Worthy of the Xbox's capabilities. The images you see on the web site is what you get in the game.\nThere is great facial animation when your character is engaged in a dialog. They switch camera views throughout a dialog sequence. These are all typical camera techniques from TV and movies but rearly get put into RPG dialogs.\nWhen you run thru a field, the plants part and then slowly fall back into place. Not necessary but a beautiful addition.\nVoice talent is superb. Even when the aliens speak in alien tongue you can tell from their intonation when they are speaking positively or negatively.\nVery easy to learn interface, even for a non RPGer. Tutorial weaves perfectly into the game.\nWhich brings me to the 3rd major pro- the game has a very engaging storyline and quests that seem to fold well into the overall storyline. Some quests are not required but do seem to make sense in the overall storyline. I will probably play this game from the beginning again so I can try fulfilling those quests that I missed.\nGameplay is essentially turn-based but it means it frees you up to manage each of your characters during combat. This is important if you are to win against a strong opponent. The interface will let you chain a sequence of actions by using the X button. This is not in the intro tutorial but is in the manual.\nCons:\nSeriously addictive.

(*eye roll*) Anyways, at the end of this commercial he charges the TV camera, drink in fist and throws out the phrase, \"So you can keep your romantic comedies and lady drinks...\" because blah ditty blah blah.  Now, normally I would pay absolutely no attention to this AT ALL, but when the screen faded to black and something infinitely more ridiculous came on the screen I heard my husband chuckle. (*insert raised eyebrow*)\n\"What's so funny?\" I asked glaring at the man to my right.\n\"You are soooo not a girl.\" He says.\n\"WTH are you talking about?\" I spit back.  \"The last time I checked homey...I had boobs.\"\n\"Romantic comedies and lady drinks (chuckle) You...my lovely bride are so not a girl.\"\n\"Am so!\" Sticks tongue out in true 2-year-old fashion.\n\"Hand me your phone.\"\n(I have to admit, this is the part where I started to get a little concerned.)\n\"What do you need my phone for?\" I ask.\n\"I'm going to prove something to you.\"\n(Chuckle.)\n(Glare.)\n\"Look...right here. Look at the movies you have on your phone.\"\n\nI (of course) took the phone in a huge huff about to disprove my arrogant husband. Yeah...no such luck.  As it turns out, I am indeed a dude. (In case you were wonder the movies were \"28 Days Later\" \"Daybreakers\" \"Legion\" \"Zombieland\" and \"Avatar\")\n\nWell...all of this got me thinking.  I don't read enough romance.  Yes...I read my fair share of \"I'm a warewolf...aren't I hot\" but true unadulterated romance? Not so much.  Then I realized (smacks forehead) that most of my followers are women and (unlike me) they are probably really into the whole \"swooning\" thing, (aka \"romantic comedies and girly drinks.\") So...I decided enough was enough. I would read a girl book.  It's not like I've never done it before, hell...I used to be addicted to Nora Roberts and (hangs head) Danielle Steele. I would dissect my TBR, I WOULD find a damn lady book, and dag nabbit...I was going to present this damn book to the masses.\n\nHere is what I found, (cue indignant smile) \"Return of the Runaway Bride\" by Donna Fasano.\n\n  Once upon a time...\n\n  There lived a lovely young woman named Savanna who was engaged to Daniel, a handsome law student. Theirs was to be a fairy-tale wedding. But Savanna's second thoughts were too big to be ignored, so the would-be bride ran away.\n\n  As the years passed...\n\n  Daniel's heart turned to ice. It was this unfeeling man that Savanna faced upon her return. The love of her youth was now a stranger. Could Savanna ever make Daniel understand why she abandoned him? And could she convince the man of her dreams he would always be her Prince Charming?\n\nSo what did I actually think about my lady-venture when it was all said and done? Not to shabby.  I will admit, the whole \"I'm running from my perfect life\" had me a little baffled at first, but once the concept was fully formed it made perfect sense.  This what not a book about a girl who made a mistake and then came back 6 years later to grovel at the feet of her \"perfect\" Prince Charming, this was about a girl who needed to get her hands dirty to realize what life is really all about. ( <-wow, that was very Yoda like of me. *takes a bow*)\n\nIf I'm to break it down further...the story wasn't really about Savanna running away at all, (Ok, that's only partially true) but more about the characters that eventually surround her \"new\" life and the changes she has made to make amends.  So what did I think about these characters? Spot-on!\n\nI don't know about the rest of you but I grew up in a painfully tiny town, and can contest to the amount of nosy-ness they possess.  In regards to this particular aspect,  I think Fasano captured it perfectly.  As for the leads themselves, (Savanna and Daniel) I think their internal turmoil led to some fascinating encounters and their inability to trust one another created fantastic doors for Fasano to navigate their \"less than normal\" relationship through.\n\nThe writing?  It was pleasant.  There were no major editing issues, there was just enough push and pull to keep you fully engaged in the relationship and there were no obvious plot lulls (which I have to admit..is a nice change of pace.)\n\nSo where exactly does this leave me overall?\n\nWell, beside the fact that I need to find a new word for \"so\" (what was that, like 50 times in 4 paragraphs?) It was a nice pleasant read, with a nice pleasant story, that wasn't too long or too short.  Perfect for those of you who like easy reads or beachy type romantic romps.\n\nWas it the best dip into \"Girl World\" I've ever had?

When Midnight Club 1 was around im pretty sure thats when Burnout came on the scene, and Burnout looked spectacularly better. However this game is extremely fun, and yet frustrating.\nYou street race. There is an incredible likeness to \"The Fast and the Furious\". You can do nitro, which basically looks like fast and furious, and feels pretty cool too as you watch the scenery speed by you. You street race by picking cars to race with. I do not know the difficulty of any of the cars, so when you start up a series of races(with saves in between) you honestly don't know what your getting into. I did this race with this guy called Victor on the first area, and was sorely beaten, but eventually found a way to knock him off his high horse for his car. It can be frustrating, doing a race several times just to memorize the map. You usually don't have time to look at your map and stay focused, so you will probably play a mission about 5 times until you get the hang of it. Then there are stupid mistakes that you do and the AI won't do. Like miss a turn, which screws you out of the checkpoint, which will make you lose the race. Or hitting a car and losing the lead. The AI never misses the turn, have usually 2 different set routes, and sometimes will screw you bad. Once I was about to win and one of the enemies pulled in front of me, stopped his car, and didn't move for a bit. I noticed all the other racers passed me easily. Then there are the people you race against. They are extremely annoying, constantly telling you stuff about how your driving is terrible or how you need to stop doing something before they get \"mad\". I raced against this guy called Angel, he kept saying stuff through the whole match. I get second place, he gets 7th and he STILL says I am terrible at the end. Even if you beat your opponent but lose to one of the other racers, your opponent will tell you all this stuff about how much you ... I just wanna nail them into a gas pump and watch them explode over and over again. Then once you win you get their car.\nOk so besides the campaign, theres other modes. Arcade mode, which lets you cruise around the environments you've unlocked, and battle mode, which has detonate or capture the flag. They alright. You cannot customize cars in this game, or build your own levels. I would of had so much fun building a straight track that goes for about a quater mile, with other cars lined up watching me race my sister. However, all you can customize are races, and things during the race. Weather, traffic, and daylight. You can set traffic to low, but it still isn't a clear path. Theres online play, which I don't have the card to play it, so I don't know what it's like.\nSo you wanna know what I think? The game is fun, cruise around. Go do some battle mode. Make a race and see how you do. No high scores or anything, but hey, you're here for the adrenaline rush.

The film also featured up and coming actors Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn with film veteran George C. Scott as the Commandant of Bunker Hill Military Academy. I've been a huge fan of Cruise ever since I saw that 1981 film.\n\nAbout a month or so prior to the release of Interview with a Vampire, a coworker told me the film was a best-selling Anne Rice Novel. After learning this, I borrowed the dramatized audio version from my local library to get the extra details I knew the film would leave out. If I could only use two words to describe my experience they would be BLOWN AWAY!\n\nIn fact, I was so taken in by the dramatized audio version of the book that I knew there was no way the Warner Brothers film could capture the essence of what I had already experienced. But, since I'm such a big fan of Cruise, I plunked down my hard earned greenbacks like everyone else, expecting a mediocre visual experience at best.\n\nCould Cruise become the Vampire Lestat I had experienced? Could new comer Brad Pitt actually become Louis? And what of Claudia? How in the world could a young Kirsten Dunst ever hope to pull off such a well defined character?\n\nWell, not only did Cruise bring to life the Vampire Lestat, but Pitt and Dunst were equally enthralling in their roles as well. The casting was flawless. This is one to see as director Neil Jordan did an excellent job of bringing the pages of the best-seller to the big screen.\n\nThe 1994 film was shot on location in New Orleans, San Francisco, England, Paris, and also offers excellent performances from Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea, Christian Slater, and new comer, Thandie Newton, who later starred opposite cruise in Mission Impossible 2.\n\nThis film has everything: love, hate, life, death, ecstasy, terror, and murder. Check this one out, y'all! If you've already seen it, see again, or get the audio version and get a different experience. You won't be disappointed.", "I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be careful what types of products I use, especially on my face.  This eye serum/lotion did not irritate my skin at all.  It has a nice subtle scent-it smells fresh with a touch of floral.  It comes out the consistency of a thin lotion and spreads on leaving a silky sheen and feel on the surface of the skin.  A little bit goes a long way-a pea-sized amount provided full coverage for both eye areas (under eyes, to the sides, and on the lids).\n\nI noticed results within the first 2 days of using this.  I have dark circles with faint crows feet on the under/sides of my eyes.  I applied this first at night and when I woke up, the circles were more smooth and less dark by about a shade.  By the second day, the skin around my eyes, where the faint crows feet were, the skin looked fuller and you could barely see the lines.  The improvements continued for 3-5 days and have since plateaued at a nice place-firm skin around the eyes and very minimal circles.\n\nI am not sure how long these results will last when I stop using this cream, but it really does work.  The reason I gave it 4/5 stars is the price-it is currently listed at $125 per 0.5 oz. container.

In typical Sega fashion, this game breaks new ground and leads the RPG genre into a risky, and very different direction. First warning: If you like to level up until you have godlike powers, and then storm through the level, look elsewhere. You start off in each dungeon at level 1, and can carry only a few items with you when you enter. What I feel is the hardest part about getting into Timestalkers is the break from the old \"level-up\" stratum that the RPG genre seems to be bound to at the hip. There is no, I repeat NO level gains between dungeons. All level ups are done in the dungeon, and once you beat the boss, you are back to level one again. However, you do increase as your class increases, allowing you to have more abilities and skills, which do follow you from dungeon to dungeon. The graphics are quite colorful, and are a pleasant break away from the Squaresoft style, which has permeated virtually every RPG on the face of the planet.  The music is downright strange, but if anything, interesting enough to keep me listening to it. Combat is an interesting matter. You are placed on a grid with your opponents and engage in turn-based combat. The only real difference that separates this from the traditional RPG is the ability to move along these grid squares in combat, which can affect your various skills and strengths. As though Pokemon has spread a virus throughout the world, yes, monster collecting is in the game, and yes, you can use them in combat to either help you or battle your opponents.

As noted, the individual components are more expensive if bought separately, but at the end of the day, only the moisturizer is worthy of that individual price, and competitors make a less expensive, comparable quality product for face soap and astringent.\n\nIf you are looking for a gift, this is a nice package.  If you are looking for yourself, get the moisturizer from Batxer and get the other items elsewhere.", "Nice listening....recording quality seems good.  Beneficial for good background sounds.", "After reading numerous reviews on issues with firewalls and such, I decided to go ahead and try this, knowing I could return it if it didn't work out.\n\nFirst off, I researched to ensure it would work with Vista and I found the v1.06 drivers and downloaded them from the Nintendo website.\n\nHere is what I'm running:\n\nD-Link DI-604 cable router with firewall\nKaspersky Internet Suite 7.0.0.125\nWindows Vista Home Premium 32-bit\n\nI first installed the drivers and then connected the USB Dongel when prompted. Vista noticed a new network had connected and I told it to use it locally.\n\nNext, I fired up the Wii and configured the network and it immediately connected and started downloading updates to the Wii. Next, I tested the news and the weather and they worked. I didn't have to open up any \"holes\" in the router firewall or Kaspersky Internet Suite.\n\nIt was VERY easy but this might not work for everyone, considering the \"horror\" stories that are abound in here.\n\nI would say the worst you can do is try it and have it not work. Just ensure you can return it if it doesn't work.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the performance and it appears to be working just fine. It is warm to the touch, but nothing like others have stated where it's too hot to touch. I'm also using the extended USB cable they give to ensure it has a clear path to the Wii.\n\n01/03/2008 Update\nWell, even though it worked great for me, I decided to return it and go with a wireless router just because it is more flexible and there was one minor issue that bugged me but didn't detract from the WiFi connector from performing it's job. There was also a major issue that had me concerned, but it had nothing to do with the functionality.\n\nThe minor issue I had was that the icon in my Windows task bar would occasionally pop up a balloon message stating someone had connected to the WiFi USB connector. This apparently was due to the Wii connecting to the internet on occasion to download news, weather and system updates. It was just annoying to see that message pop up in the lower right-hand corner of my screen and it appeared to occur at least once every 10 minutes or so and I couldn't find any way to turn that off.\n\nThe major issue that has me concerned is that the Nintendo website states this WiFi connector is temporarily unsupported at this time. It gave\nno explanation as to why this has happened. This had me worried since they don't say when they will support it again, if ever and why it's no longer supported.\n\nOtherwise, this thing still worked like a charm! I downloaded some software with it and it worked flawlessly. It's still a great thing to have if you don't have a wireless network set up and don't want to have to set one up and you're not concerned about it not being supported. But, for the same price, you can get a pretty decent wireless router that will allow you to connect other devices. You'll just have to set up the security yourself, but most routers these days make it very easy to do so.", "A mouse actually chewed a small tunnel through concrete into my garage. I used this to fill the small channel to the outside to keep out the elements (and hopefully more mice). This stuff expanded fast, and a little more as it dried. It's fairly strong yet a little flexible. It's been in place for quite a while now and has held up nicely. I didn't use much, and was surprised to find that the tube/applicator for the spray can was easily cleared to use again. I'd assumed the product would expand, dry, and block the nozzle. I was able to just pull it right out and use it again later.", "Another winner from Agatha Christie.", "A bit more tart and sassy than William Brown's normal style...at times it reminded of a Nelson De Mille novel as to the crisp  dialogue This change of pace is what  made the book so thoroughly enjoyable as to the characters.

A great book for a vacation read---any season.", "They fit perfect, extremely comfortable", "With \"Bringing it All Back Home\" from 1965 Bob Dylan changed limits for when music should be called pop, folk, beat or blues. After releasing four excellent acoustic albums filled with clever original songs,  Dylan here took the step into electric music, by allowing one side of the album to be accompanied by electric guitars, bass and drums.\n\nFive of these songs were basically 12 bar blues with raw unpolished electric accompaniment. Among these \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" and \"Maggie's Farm\" have become classics of the period, while \"She Belongs to Me\" and \"Love Minus Zero / No Limit\" are two of the most beautiful love songs Dylan has ever released. Both are available in numerous cover versions - Rick Nelson has for example brilliantly interpreted both songs.\n\nOn side two of the original album, Dylan is back in his usual music approach with his acoustic guitar, harmonica and his own characteristic vocals. Lyrically, however, Dylan has moved himself,  towards the more surreal and refined. Also here we have some of his greatest classics like \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" two songs which The Byrds superbly chose to interpret.\n\nIn short, this is an album that set new standards for modern music and an album all music lovers deserve to hear.", "An excellent compact tuner that fits easily into pocket or gig bag.  I recommend it without reservation.", "This thing is just the ticket for any kind of mixing. Plenty deep, nice finish, and easy to clean.", "Currently using this product as a memory book for me and a special someone. :) Very sturdy material used for the cover AND there are sheets + sheet covers for starters (which are just as good quality).

Contents of box were well protected and everything was present. One note about assembly ... take your time - read and follow instructions for additional insight (a booklet is shipped with the unit and when I purchased it, a separate/sightly different \"manual\" was available on the internet) - use wrenches not a ratchet set (I find that hand tightening ensures a snug and proper installation with minimal risk of stripping or shearing the fasteners) - hand tighten all of the screws on the item especially the ones that were installed by the manufacturer - and store / move / use with care ... the metal components (all light to medium grade aluminum), and various parts, are functional but not \"commerical grade\". Took way more time to assemble than advertised. Assembled unit looks great. Works and heats nicely - is somewhat of a propane hog. We enjoy the unit a lot !!!

It's really easy, so even the 2 year old doesn't need a heck of a lot of help.\n\nA drawback is that it's really easy to bump the game and make the cherries roll all over the place.  You want to avoid this because there are no extra cherries, so you don't want to lose them.\n\nMy husband & I aren't in love with this game, but the kids like it.  It's a good one for them to play without us.  Fine.\n\nI'd say our 2 year old likes this more than the other kids.  It's her favorite.", "I went into this book highly aware of its much lower ratings compared to its three predecessors. Before starting I also anticipated to give the book a lower rating, based also on the fact that two of my favorite characters, Daenerys and Tyrion would not be making appearances. Now, after finishing it, I'm quite conflicted.\n\nThrough 90% of the book I was very bored, fell asleep regularly and even had to reread a few parts a second time. However, the last 150 pages or so really picked up pace and there came the jaw dropping moments that was so common in the first three books. Originally I was going to give it three stars, but the ending was enough to bring it up one. With this said, if you wish to read this, expect boredom as Martin presents characters duller than normal, countless plots that don't come to anything and just more blah, blah, blah fillers.\n\nAlso, I don't know what you really get out of the characters that didn't have their perspective told before, like the ones from the Iron Islands, and the princess from Dorne. Must have been just the blah blah fillers I mentioned.\n\nplease Please PLEASE let the next one be better. This series is just too good to go down the toilet at this stage in the game.", "Very easy to use. Good price.", "In the world of Fable, literally every action has a consequence. Go drinking: get a beer gut. Kill a helpless merchant: people get worried when you come around. Steal an item: your soul gets a little darker, and horns begin to come out of your head.\n\nFable is an intricate story in a vast world, and is a wildly entertaining game. Since many reviews here laud the game's many great qualities, I just want to run down a few of the \"buyer beware\" cons:\n\n1) For being a main villain in an otherwise rich in-game universe, Jack of Blades is woefully underdeveloped.\n2) The melee system is intuitive but it's a little hard to hit the intended target when facing multiple enemies sometimes.\n3) The archery view is difficult to move in and out of on the fly.\n4) Hot-keying items can be a pain.\n5) ... so can switching between the dozens of spells.\n\nThough I have to say, these all pale in comparison to learning the ancient symbolic dance of the sages - which is the YMCA. It's this sense of humor that makes Fable fun over and over, from a door that requires you to be a \"mattress addict\" before it lets you get past (to get a pimp hat, no less) or an in-game storybook being read to children that has medieval gangstas and their posses in it. That, and a huge number of sidequests, ensure that this game will keep you occupied for a while.", "Seeing as 2001 was such a huge year for gaming, it makes sense that some highly worthwhile titles would get passed over.  Unfortunately, two outstanding PS2 racing games from the same company (Acclaim) suffered this fate, one being the superlative Burnout, and the other being Extreme-G 3.\nI can't help but think that many gamers wrote this off as a Wipeout clone, or figured it was of the same quality as the two preceding N64 games, but that's really too bad.  Yes, XG3 is in fact influenced by Wipeout, but it has enough differing elements to make it quite a worthy competitor for the title of Best Futuristic Racer.  In XG3, you race some Akira-style jet-cycles around some spectacular tracks, in a mad supersonic dash to cross the finish line.  What sets this game apart from other racers are the weapons/turbo/shield system, the unmatched sense of speed, and the vertigo-inducing, gorgeous circuits.\nAt the outset of Career Mode, your bike (which is a dead ringer for the Lightcycles from the film Tron) is outfitted with a standard cannon and shield.  As you fly around the rollercoaster-like tracks, there are purple and green strips to drive over, which refill your ammunition and shields, respectively.  What makes the races more strategical than most is that your shield and turbo both draw energy from the same source.  Use all the energy for turbo, and you might find yourself without a shield, making you an easy target for the weapons of other bikes, and you better not hit the walls, or else.  Save all the energy for your shield, and you'll find yourself in last place pretty quickly.  This is a wonderful innovative touch that makes every race a constant chessmatch, albeit at 600+ miles per hour.  Oh yes - use your ammo wisely, or you may find yourself on an opponent's tail with no way to take him (or her) out.  I must also mention the amazing thing that happens when you break the sound barrier...but I'll leave that for you to discover yourself. The bikes handle great, but I highly recommend configuring the controls, which are completely customizable, thankfully.  I remapped the turbo and fire buttons to R1 and L1 - it works perfectly and is much more comfortable.\nThe track designs are nothing less than beautiful, inspired, clever works that will leave your stomach in knots and your mind in awe.  Whether it be the Blade Runner-esque Astradaitoshi (complete with rain effects, full moon, and neon billboards.....and at some points the skyscrapers go horizontal!), the sunset-drenched Nuon Harbor, or my personal favorite, Oceania (with a hair-raising vertical loop - we're talking straight up and straight down here - and transparent underwater tunnels), each one is a unique and detail-filled challenge.  Yes, there are only ten tracks, but they're so diverse and magnificent it doesn't matter.  I'd rather have ten highly polished and diverse tracks - with no slowdown, even at 1000 mph - than twice that many with repetitive or mirrored tracks.\nAs you progress through Career Mode, you earn credits which can then be spent to upgrade your bike, whether it be a more powerful engine, a high range of weapons (ranging from heat-seeking missiles to mines to an electro-magnetic pulse), or nifty items like an extra shield generator or an ammo or shield scoop, which enables you to gain an additional energy supply from the strips on the track.  You also progress through several leagues, each with its own speed class.  You end up racing the same tracks in each league, but since the speed class is upgraded each time, it's like racing them anew.  There is also a time attack mode which nets you extra credits (hint: beat the lap record for each track and watch your required finishing place drop in league races). Another interesting twist is the Two-Player Career Mode, in which you and a friend work in tandem through the circuits.  It's a very welcome cooperative feature.  There is also a more typical two-player mode, which is just as sharp as single-player, and just as fun.\nAll told, there's a lot to like here.  The increasing difficulty of Career Mode isn't conquered easily, and the multiplayer features add a lot of gameplay.  XG3 doesn't seem to be getting quite the attention it deserves.  Its sense of speed is intoxicating, its graphics unbelievable, and its fun factor immediate and sky-high.  The sensation of traveling faster than the speed of sound never gets old.  Next to Burnout, XG3 is the best arcade-style PS2 racer to date.", "I only gave it 4 stars because I, personally, have never eaten it.  I can say that boy my boys like it.

This is also a rare occurrence in my romance book, to find such \"Ultimate Love Story\" that captivates your whole heart and soul when you reach the end! Put it kindly, This book is a keeper that I will read time and time again and never tire of it! This author has a gift in crafting her story-telling with words that show you images that go straight to your heart...This is a love story that stood the test of death and grew into a lasting love this author wrote with so much passion and heart and ultimately that \"essence\" was reflected in her characterization of both Hero & heroine! This romance has everything, action, suspense and love story that for those who like their romance to be the sole focus in the book, then look no Further! It pleased me immensely that the romance part was not overshadowed by other plots, but was a constant presence in the book and it allowed the reader to know both hero & heroine! The emotional depth was so well crafted, I was simply \"mesmerized\" with each word/actins both characters executed and I was glued to the pages not wanting them to end!\n\nThe main lead..He's the ultimate Hero! A man used to being out in the wilderness and having trained with the military Special Forces as well as with the GhostWalker teams. Most of his life he had been cold and dispassionate in his dealings with people and never been able to form any emotional connection with another human being...until he met her...From the moment he saw her, I was devouring his each thought process...how much he wanted her, craved her and wanted to touch her! Seriously, throughout the book there was not a moment he wanted to separate himself from heroine...it may sound a bit extreme, but not in this case..This hero was used to being cold from the inside, not having any feelings/emotions and what he felt for heroine was completely foreign to him! I really enjoyed his transformation..he was caring, possessive and considerate and I was absolutely heartbroken each time there was a portrayal of his vulnerability when he though he was Losing the heroine...\n\nHe was without a question a Hero to die for...heroine was his absolute everything and he hoped he would represent something good in her life in spite of his \"dark nature\" and he gave 100% to prove it to her! What's more important...he recognized heroine as \"his equal\" in terms of their abilities and admired her Intelligence, courage, and compassion that he so desperately needed but just did not know it at the time! I like the sound of that..an equal partnership in a relationship, it makes more believable and sincere..\"Both\" were supporting each other and giving strength...Its a relationship that could set an example in real world! The heroine was also a worthy partner for the Hero! She was beautiful from the outside and inside and despite her compassionate and understanding nature she was not a push over..she stood her ground and fought when needed....I loved that about her that she was so independent and courageous! A true match for the Hero! This book was just perfect in every way! It has everything that I need in a romance and it made me feel so happy inside!

And the game continues to evolve, with new features being added (as well as old features being nerfed). The game is always in a state of development, not from a stability standpoint (I've had the game crash on me only once even while beta testing), but from a features standpoint.\nI'll say this, though - this game is a BLAST. Playing around in the Star Wars galaxy is intensely addictive and has given me hours upon hours of fun. If I get bored doing one thing, I can try something completely different. Want to blast a whole cornucopia of Star Wars monsters? Just wander out of town. Want to tinker around building things for a while? Go mine some resources, pick up a crafting tool, and you're on your way. Want a pet Bantha? Just fly on over to Mos Eisly and wander off into the hills. Feel like getting down and dirty and fighting some real people? Head into a rowdy faction town and start some static. Personally, whenever I tire of one facet of the game, there are always two others that catch my interest.\nAnother great aspect of the game is that the people who play it are, for the most part, courteous, intelligent, friendly, helpful, well-spoken, and generally fun to be around. I've never personally met anyone who was rude and have met quite a few people who are fun to get together with and go adventuring.\nSure, if you go to the SWG boards, you will see complaints about things being nerfed and game elements being switched around, but personally, each change has just changed HOW I play the game, not how much I enjoy it.

There were high hopes riding on \"The Avengers\" in the Summer of 1998 with a dream cast of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and the iconic Sean Connery.  Things didn't bode well for the film when the film's release date kept getting pushed back.  Things looked even worse when the film wasn't even previewed for the critics and naturally the daggers were drawn when it was seen and the public followed suit.  I saw it in the theatre and was disappointed because it didn't meet my expectations.  But what were my expectations?  Is this a bad film because it isn't the film I thought it should be?  I don't know why I revisited \"The Avengers\" but I'm glad I did.  Common criticisms of the film at the time are these.  Fiennes as John Steed and Thurman as Emma Peel had no chemistry.  Connery as Sir August De Wynter was lackluster as the villain.  London, a bustling city, is oddly bereft of people.  Eddie Izzard as one of Connery's henchmen has no dialogue which is strange for a man who makes his living as a stand-up comic.  For the first two criticisms I'll say the critics are dead wrong.  For the second two I'll say that the makers of the film were making an ironic stab at comedy that may have gone over some people's heads.  Viewing this film unbiased by the criticisms at the time of it's release I'll say it's chief virtues are not only Fiennes, Thurman, and Connery but also terrific supporting work by Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, and Eileen Atkins. Patrick MacNee also has a decent cameo.  The film has decent production values and special effects but they're secondary to some cheeky dialogue notably between Fiennes and Thurman.  It's rare that I do a 180 on a film but that's the case here.  This film may have its detractors but if you go into it with an open mind you may find delight in \"The Avengers\".", "Very durable shirt for work.

It can improve the taste of less expensive wines.\nIt has long been my habit to experiment with various types of wines at various prices, usually side by side. Generally I let the wine breathe in the bottle for a bit, then a bit more in the glass. I had found many of the \"Oak\" california wines a bit disappointing in particular because of the sharpness in the initial taste.\nI purchased this decanter mainly to have a more attractive means of serving wine to guests. The decanter met that objective admirably but more importantly it improved the taste of the first wines I tried in it. I went back an purchased some of the wines I had previously dismissed and found that the decanter really does take the edge off making the wine more supple and smooth.\nIts not all good news. In some instances the wine did not improve and in fact became thin and lack some of its previous life. I also noticed immediately (being a fanatic for not mixing wines) that if I was sampling several wines that it took a long while for the decanter to dry (and no use trying to wipe it out due to its shape). Thus you are somewhat limited to what you can decant at one setting (one decanter, one wine).\nThat being said I am contemplating buying a couple more so that I can continue my side by side examinations of wines and decant them all equally.

I have played and beaten Ratchet and Clank the first, and am about to beat number 2.  I do love this game, but I thinks it's important for me to point out it's flaws for Ratchet and Clank fans'\n1.  Compared to RC1, I found this game to be significantly EASIER!  That's right, easier.  I read one post or two saying it's hard.  MOST of this game is easier than RC1, except obstacle courses (like gliders and levitators), hoverbike races, giant clank battles (one in particular), that sort of thing.  The levels I feel like were longer (I think so anyway', tough to tell), but just easier.\n2. I think most of the increased ease is because of the plethora of weapons and upgrades.  Although the weapon acquiring and upgrades can be cool, I feel they took more center stage than necessary on this one.  I'd like to see a reduction here in the next installment.  Also, your armor can be upgraded to the point of ridiculous  indestructibility.  They SHOULD NOT ever go beyond this in a future addition.  In fact, they should find a way to scale it down a bit (which would also require some ' though not much ' scaling down of opponents' damage capabilities, possibly Ratchet's too.)\n3. I also felt the puzzles were easier overall (a few exceptions).  The two intrusive devices, the Electrolyzer (a 2D grid with moving lights and 2 way switches ' it even sounds too easy when described), and the Infiltrator (a globe device where you have to guess the path of the traveling' gas it sounds like) were just not as difficult as the device in RC1 (forgot what that was called).  I felt the device from RC1 was a much cooler design, and it felt like the puzzle was making me think on different levels at once. (Three circle of lasers and reflectors that have to aligned to different targets' heck it even sounds hard).  Though even RC1 was guilty of allowing some of these puzzles to be too easy on later levels (Hint to Insomniac, make the puzzles later in the game HARDER).  That being said, I think the Infiltrator had potential if the puzzles were harder overall, but the Electrolyzer was hopeless.  Perhaps a new 'level' could somehow be added to the Infiltrator.\n4. NOT ENOUGH CLANK MISSIONS!  I find myself missing the little guy in this one.  They have Clank missions, but they all seemed easier and shorter.  None of them are as long or cool as the one from Orxon on RC1.  In fact, I was disappointed that in RC1 once you played the Clank missions, the area was 'freed up' and couldn't access those areas anymore with Clank.  Unless you start and play a whole new game!  Hint Insomniac: make Clank missions replayable as a game, just like the arena and hoverbike race!  Also, make more little Clank missions next time, long and tough please!\n5. More specifically on Weapons, the modifications you can get with the platinum bolts are cool, but I don't really like the electricity or gas mods that gave any modded weapon an area of effect quality.  Each mod should be just the cool strafing mods or something specific to the weapon.\n6. Again on the weapons' I think it's the upgrades (using your weapon so much they get more power) that imbalanced the game.  After upgrading my weapons, everything became easy' even the Impossible Challenge in the Arena!  Or they needed a harder than impossible challenge for people who are fully upgraded.  Now there's nothing I can't beat easily.\n7. Too many weapons that work for you!  In RC1, you only had the glove of doom, little robots that ran on the ground and self destructed.  There was also the Visibomb guided missile, which wasn't quite as cheap.  Using the Glove of Doom always made me feel cheap though.  In RC2, you have stationary turrets that you can place and they shoot for you, flying robots that follow you and shoot for you, a shield which gets upgraded to deal damage to anything that touches you, and a Sniper rifle for picking guys off from far away (it has an awesome zoom feature).  I feel that Insomniac should limit weapons that fight for you.  These just make it too easy.  The Sniper should probably be toned down just a little (it was mostly fine).\n8. Lastly on weapons, the flamethrower (pyrocyter ' even the name is cool!) was very useful in RC1.  It was a great 'circle and fire weapon' useful for taking out little critters when they swarm you.  You can't really do that in RC2.  Yes, you do get a lava gun that functions the same basic way' but you don't find it until later in the game!  RC1 you get the pyrocyter on like the second world.  It takes significantly longer to get the lava gun.  Worse, once upgraded, the lava gun has more powerful shots, but no longer has the functionality of the lava gun/pyrocyter.  Terrible!  Instead of a constant stream, it fires volcano rocks or something' powerful but reduced and lame functionality, it became almost like the rocket launcher.  I felt cheated.  Constant stream circling is just fun and cool.  Bring it back Insomniac.\n9. The grind rails were easier on this one.  They also seemed shorter.  The grind is definitely one of the most fun aspects of this line.  Make em better I say!\n10. The hoverbike is cool and all, but I REALLY miss the hoverboard.  Bring it back, man!  Especially with the feature of the hoverbike races where THEY attack YOU.  Do this for the hoverboard, and it'll totally rock!  You could also have antigravity sections (kinda like the magnetic boot sections for Ratchet) for the board, or bike, or BOTH!\n11. Ratchet's best possible battle armor is kinda lame' because you never really need it.  And worse it covers your whole Face!  I want to see ratchet!  They hid him!  Even if it were necessary, I would never purchase the armor just cause it hides his face!  LAME!\n12. In general, I don't see the need for weapons and armor that are super high priced and you will NEVER need!  The Zodiac weapon and the best armor you don't need at all to win or beat any battle.  And they cost so much you need to spend ridiculous amounts of time collecting money.  Next time, every weapon and armor should be needed.  And they should cut down the cost so that you acquire them in half to 2/3's the amount of time.\n13. The AI for monsters is still too dumb.  Slight improvement over the last one, that's it.  They need to make it even harder.\n14. If it matters to you, the story is not as good as RC1.  RC1 had a simple but cool n effective storyline.  RC2 is more like Hollywood hack stuff.  Won't go into it in more detail (and better English!) because it's not really critical to this game.  They might try a plot where Ratchet and Clank are chased throughout, rather than planet hopping to chase some bad guy'\nI thinks that's it for the negatives.  Things this thing is great at'\n1. WHOA!  The replay value on this one is much higher, because of all the frigging games: hoverbike races, arena battles, the space ship battles, and Giant clank battles.  They really needed more of these, especially the giant clank missions.  They could totally expand on Giant Clank (see the mods note for the ship below).\n2. Mods on the ship rule!  I love my tiger yellow spaceship (color is the last thing you should worry about though).  I was surprised that these mods were mostly balanced.  Perhaps the shields make it a little too easy, and the space mines, but only a little.  Oddly enough, the mini-nuclear missile I didn't find to be overly powerful at all, just right.  Keeping the same weapons here would be fine.  Wouldn't want to see a lot of expansion on these here, maybe some device to help track opponents better, or navigate/fly better.  Otherwise, they just need more space missions, Rah!\n3. Beautiful, absolutely beautiful.  Probably even better looking in RC2 than in RC1.  Actually definitely better.  Each world is immersive and real.\n4. Globe worlds rock.  Gimmee more!\n5. The Tractor beam is a great gadget!  I love it.  Especially moving the robots around.  The water freezer/heater is cool too.  Maybe incorporate some spots in the game where you can swing in a circular pattern on the swingshot, and have it fling you further!  But it's more difficult to control and only useful when reaching large platforms!  Great mod for that one, and it wouldn't require much change!\n6. A gadget that allows you to control robots and operate them.  Totally cool.  But I think they put more of these in there at the expense of little clank missions...boo\nAll in all, great.  I just like RC1 better on its first pass. (I will review it here later).  Again the replay for RC2 is pretty darn good.  They should 'ratchet' it up one level next time, to the true level of  'forever insomniac'  heheh.", "Got it from HSN in December. Returned it because of Tracphone's outrageous cost per minute.

It really is a great way to interpret Jane Austen's beloved novel \"Pride and Prejudice.\"  What if the events of both Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet took them down different paths.  Would they still end up together? Would they still fall in love? We wonder about our own lives and how if we took a different path and life would we end up at the same spot?\n\nSo you see the author is not attempting to rewrite Pride and Prejudice or give it a sequel. Even if you are critical when it comes to fiction about Jane Austen or Pride and Prejudice, I think you will enjoy this book emensely.  I will issue a warning that some of the language and the style are not like that of Jane Austen. I enjoyed how even though the two main characters met on a ship, certain events or converstations took place that also took place in Pride and Prejudice. For example, the discussion of an \"accomplished lady,\" or Charles Bingley's letting of Netherfield Park.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Pride and Prejudice and don't understand what is written above here is the scenario:\n\nElizabeth Bennet is sailing to America to see her aunt and uncle who are in New York on business. This is not in modern times, so a unmarried woman travelling on a ship for a month unattended is a little dangerous.  Another person travelling to America is Fitzwilliam Darcy, he owns the ship they are travelling on and does not want anyone to know it. In fact he wants little to do with anyone on the ship. He just wants to go to America to retrieve his sister rather than have her come back unattended.  Mr. Darcy is of course ver wealthy and the target of many matching making mother aboard the ship.  Elizabeth is in the steerage which is the lowest and poorest part of the ship.  These two characters keep bumping into each other, Darcy is concerened when Elizabeth is ill and will not get any better because of the poor living conditions she is in on the ship.  Mr. Darcy makes her an extraordinary offer. . .\n\nI will not tell you any more, hopefully this haas whetted your appetite.

Something I did,and I recommend you do if you haven't already,is to replace the OEM zinc plated screws. I used stainless steel screws with round heads,a quarter inch longer. I also used stainless steel washers.

This molding is quite stiff and you need to have strong fingers to install it. I recommend you do it on a warm day,when it will be reasonably pliable. I had good luck pinching a few inches at a time,inserting it on the rail,and then pressing it into the grooves. I was obliged to use an old blade tip screwdriver to open up a few dented spots on the rail grooves to get it wide enough to accept the molding edges.

(Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\nHigh-level target:  Allen Robinson  Jaguars \n Robinson  looked well on  his  way to becoming one of the top receivers in the NFL after  his  first three seasons  but this last season was cut short during the first game after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament. The injury will likely cause teams to hesitate before giving  him  a big contract  but assuming  his  recovery is on track   he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best free agent receiver available.  He \u00e2\u0080\u0099s become a well-rounded threat with the potential to win deep or turn short passes into big gains with  his  run-after-catch ability.\nOn this play from 2016   Robinson  runs a deep in-breaking route against off-coverage.\n Robinson  angles  his  routes outside initially  to sell a vertical route to the corner. As  he  reaches the top of  his  route   he  manages to get the corner to open  his  hips to the sideline  creating lots of separation as  Robinson  cuts inside.  Robinson  makes the catch and then shows  his  ability to create after the catch  eluding defenders on  his  way to a nearly 40-yard gain.\nOne of  Robinson \u00e2\u0080\u0099s best traits is  his  body control when adjusting to the flight of the ball.  He  makes a number of spectacular catches to pull in back-shoulder throws or correct inaccurate passes.\nHere   Robinson  is isolated to the left of the formation.  He  runs a simple go route  but quarterback Blake Bortles throws to  his  back-shoulder.  Robinson  does an excellent job not only getting  his  head around and locating the throw  but turning  his  body around completely to make an incredible one-handed grab.\n Robinson   if healthy  has the ability to be a true number one receiver for whichever team  he  signs for. The injury might put some teams off  but  his  talent makes an investment in  him  worth the risk.", "Be cautious about using this with plants like vals- I put some into my cichlid tank and Im now down to about 5 tiny bunches after most of them melted.

I bought a few spares in case they were damaged by the test. They were easily able to read the ammonium chloride. I take this to indicate they will also read ammonia produced by other sources, but I can't really say for sure. I have two in a 125 gallon, and two more, one each in two 10 gallon tanks. None of these 4 have ever registered, but I'm going to go ahead and assume this is because there has never been a readable level of ammonia in my tanks.\n\nI would recommend these to any aquarist.

I will give him a few more tries though.", "What an oddity 'Rule of Rose' is! Why would anyone choose to play a game in which the main character is a nervous, awkward teenage girl and the story the game tells could best be described as disturbing? And yet, there's lots of good answers to this question. How about, just for starters: beautiful graphics, unique gameplay, and a compelling and rich plotline?\n\nThe graphics of 'Rule of Rose' are one of the things that sold me on the game almost immediately. Just watch the game's opening trailer to get a taste of what you'll see -- visually lush and beautiful animations, expressive characters, and a style perfectly suited to the game's story. Like the 'Silent Hill' series, 'Rule of Rose' takes a simple real-world environment and wraps it in darkness and just a slight tinge of surrealism to keep you off-guard. As gorgeous as the backdrop is, the creatures and dark edges of the story are rendered just as lovingly, products of a twisted imagination. In some scenes, sun streams through huge windows and bathes the world in a golden glow, while later the same windows are darkened except for occasional flashes of lightning, illuminating shuffling figures and featureless masks for faces. The visual style of 'Rule of Rose' is breathtaking, both terrible and beautiful.\n\nPlaying through 'Rule of Rose' can be frustrating at times. Jennifer, the main character of the game, is awkward, kind of slow, and clumsy with weapons. She is no fighter and is easily overpowered. This makes sense for the way the game's story is told, but can still make the experience difficult sometimes. This is more than offset, though, by the added dynamic of Jennifer's faithful friend, Brown the dog. Once you find and befriend him (early on in the game), Brown becomes your indispensible companion. He will help you find everything from restorative items (scones and lollipops for Jennifer, bacon and bones for Brown) to the next item needed to progress the story (everything from keys to teddy bears) and more. Brown also helps Jennifer in combat by frightening some enemies and giving Jennifer a better chance to strike or run away. Jennifer by herself may have made for a somewhat weak and frustrating experience overall, but playing 'Rule of Rose' with Jennifer and Brown is considerably more interesting.\n\nWhich all leads to the story. Told mainly through a series of crudely-drawn storybooks Jennifer finds and assembles along the way, 'Rule of Rose' is like a modern-day Grimm's fairytale gone horribly wrong. Thematically, the nearest comparison I can think of is William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies,' as 'Rule of Rose' is another story is which children are left to discover a society all of their own making (the mysterious Aristocrats of the Red Crayon), and the result is seldom pretty to look at. The children in 'Rule of Rose' are cruel and malicious to one another, as conniving and manipulative as any adults, and as selfish. Even so, 'Rule of Rose' is hard to turn away from, once begun. The storybook motif and the way the stories translate to Jennifer's reality are compelling, and in their own twisted way, beautiful too. Discovering the fate of the Aristocrats and the identity of the mysterious Stray Dog kept me playing to the bitter end.\n\nAdd in a surprisingly touching music score by Yutaka Minobe, consisting mainly of string arrangements that are positively haunting, and chillingly effective voice acting for each character, and 'Rule of Rose' comes together as an occasionally frustrating but overall compelling game.\n\nMind you, 'Rule of Rose' is not for everyone. The story features cruel behavior among children, and hints at physical and sexual abuse and cruelty to animals. There is very little that is overtly shown, but the undercurrent of dread and the implications of the story will frighten some and downright offend others. On the other end of the spectrum, those who like action games packed with blood and mayhem are likely to be disappointed by the slow pace of the story and the limited combat moves of the the teenage heroine. For those, however, who can appreciate a dark fairy tale, who can see beauty even in terror, who believe that even the story of a sad, unlucky, lonely girl has merit, 'Rule of Rose' is a game well worth the playing.", "This cover is designed to fit several phones.

(Yes, you read that right ... why replace something that works??)

I really didn't want an electric can opener cluttering up my counter so I was delighted to find this on Amazon (why go anywhere else first?) and the new one works just as well as the old one did. I was sorry to see it is now made in China but, surprisingly, the quality remains. Easy to use (despite arthritic hands) and always reliable. Great value for the price.\n\nUpdate: 2/15 - Just a quick note to say this can opener is still working like the day it arrived ... no rust, and the handle grips are still solidly in place with no evidence of wear or sliding. Quality is so hard to find these days; it's a pleasure to update a review with good news!", "Works great/high quality materials and design...used several times and have since purchased more products from Lincoln.", "Awesome and very durable", "Fable's main plot reads more like a book of clichd, overused storyline elements than the attention-grabbing, emotion-fluttering heavyweight it was so obviously meant to be. The nameless lead character is introduced to us as a young boy, enjoying the last few days of his innocence, when a surprise bandit raid results in the senseless slaughter of every living soul in his hometown. And, just as the bandits are about to finish the deed by wiping our young narrator from the face of the planet, he's saved at the last moment by a powerful warrior who takes the boy under his wing and trains him at his nationally-recognized \"hero school.\" I'm sure you can imagine where the story leads from there... a never-ending hunt for clues about the fate of his family, and a bloodthirsty search for revenge. Well... maybe \"bloodthirsty\" is a bit too strong of a word for this uncharismatic main character, since the limits of his emotional range seem to be mild annoyance and very slight pleasure.\n\nThere's no connection whatsoever between the main character and the main villain (which is, generally speaking, supposed to be the story's \"home run\" relationship) so their ultimate collision means next to nothing. Avoiding all the sidequests, the main plot itself is really quite short and despite all the emphasis on your decisions throughout the game affecting its outcome, the one single decision that makes a difference doesn't arrive until after you've laid the finishing touches on the end boss.\n\nIn about as short a terms as I can define it, this game plays like a mixture of Onimusha, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Obviously, with the storyline's central focus being the main character's constant struggle between darkness and light, (and the way his everyday decisions affect that status) the comparisons to KOTOR almost write themselves. Your appearance slowly changes from everyday to angelic to demonic, depending on your decisions, and is gradual enough to keep the player from noticing straight away. Likewise, by increasing your attributes in the strength or magic departments, you either slowly grow in size and stature or whither away into a shriveled, powerful magician.\n\nLike Onimusha, you don't receive the experience from your battles until you've chased down the little glowing green bubble that bursts out of the bodies of your fallen opponents. The EXP will fade away if you don't get to it in time, but you can give it a little tug in your direction by holding the \"R\" button. Accumulated experience can be spent on different abilities, (such as additional strength, the capacity to take more damage, better aim with your bow and arrow, more spells to cast in the heat of a battle, extra speed, etc.) as though you were merely shopping for items.\n\nAnd, like all of Zelda's post-N64 titles, the actual hackin' and slashin' is both challenging and enjoyable. You'll occasionally run into trouble trying to target a specific enemy in a horde, or maintaining a lock on your target while dodging arrows and blades, but that's acceptable and actually quite a ways more realistic than most of the competition. Plus, the battle system itself is loose enough to make correcting for these quirks a snap. You can choose between fighting close range with a blade, short or long range with a bow and arrow, or any distance with your magic, with each method offering unique pros and cons.\n\nAs you make your way through the game, you retrieve your main quests from the \"Hero School\". Apparently, a big part of the school's (and your character's) funding comes from the completion of various tasks, missions and requests as proposed by the world's citizens in need. Your quests range from \"help the merchant through the dark, scary woods\" to \"hunt down and decapitate the bandit mastermind,\" and are all over the board in terms of difficulty, length and reward. Gameplay is a dream come true.\n\nThe graphics are tough to classify. On one hand, they don't even compare to the photorealism of some of their contemporaries, but on the other... they don't really aim to. There's a visual flair to the graphics of Fable, a distinct style that alludes to photorealism but retains the kind of personality, emotion and, for lack of a better word, humanity, that's missing from most games. While they don't look exactly like the kind of people you'd see walking down the dirt roads of the local renaissance festival, they've got just as much emotion in their expressions, reactions and personal flair.\n\nThe audio is a home run. The villagers have almost thousands of different expressions, reactions, quips, comments and responses to fit any situation. The easily-identifiable British accent of every character in the game helps Fable stand apart from the pack, and solidifies its timeframe somewhere in the middle ages. The villagers even borrow a few lines from Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail, and while that's one of the most wrongfully-quoted movies of all time, it's used sparingly and effectively here and feels more like a funny side joke than an annoying, forced homage. The musical score is minimal, and the occasionally-necessary transition from the \"wandering alone in the forest\" theme to the \"ambushed by thieves\" theme is quick, seamless and effortless. It does its job.\n\nBasically, in Fable you've got a game that looks great, sounds great, plays like a dream, incorporates some unique new gameplay elements, features some outstanding voice acting, attempts to perfect on some tried-and-true existing mechanics, and simply lacks any sort of mentionable storyline. If you can live with making that one sacrifice to enjoy all the greatness that surrounds it, you'll really enjoy yourself with this. The big problem here wasn't necessarily in the game itself, but in all the hype and delays that cornered the title before it could even hit the market and the lack of focus on a clear, interesting story.", "Something I use regularly.

Hardly anyone has heard of it; but I love it.", "Having gotten myself into Judas Priest with this album here along with \"British Steel\" back in 2002 when I was 18 and having owned it for 13 years now, this is another one of these classic albums that I wished I would've and should've reviewed a long time ago as the same goes with some of my other Judas Priest CD's that I've owned for quite some time that I haven't reviewed yet.\n\nWell anyways here we go with the review.\n\nComing hot and fresh right off the heels of their successful 1980 classic \"British Steel\", Judas Priest's 1981 follow up release \"Point of Entry\" marked another stylistic change for the legendary UK outfit with the album featuring a much more mainstream hard rock feel with shorter songs and simpler tempos and songwriting, and yes this album here does have a much more 70's hard rock sound than any album that Judas Priest released during the 70's as many reviewers mentioned before. True, \"Point of Entry\" may be more laid back and not as blazing or blistering as \"British Steel\" and \"Screaming For Vengeance\" (both of which I've reviewed before), but it still rocks hard no question about it. The music on this album is no doubt very superb and every song is definitely worth cranking the volume up at 100. Rob Halford's vocals on here are top notch as usual, as are the dueling guitars of Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing, and of course bassist Ian Hill and drummer Dave Holland both provide an excellent rhythm section as they drive this album nicely through one song after the next.\n\nEvery song on here is a winner, but here's a look at some of the highlights.\n\nThe album's first track \"Heading Out to the Highway\" is a great opening track and one of my favorites that features great driving riffs backed by a great driving drum beat throughout, plus great vocals from Halford and a nice catchy chorus. This song really shows that Judas Priest have always been known for great album openers, and this one is definitely one of them. The second song \"Don't Go\" is a slower tempoed yet awesome rocker that includes more great vocals by Halford accompanied by Tipton and Downing's nice rocking riff work, plus another great chorus and a nice solo is also featured, while track three \"Hot Rockin'\" is an excellent and catchy heavy mid paced rocker that boasts plenty of great energetic, punchy riffing, and screaming solos, and great drumming all led by Halford's incredible vocal deliveries. The chorus in this song is also awesome as well. Definitely another one of my favorites on the album. Elsewhere, track four \"Turning Circles\" is another slower paced and melodic rocker that features great melodic guitar work from Tipton and Downing throughout, plus another great chorus is also included, and track five and my favorite off the album \"Desert Plains\" is yet another strong, driving melodic rock number that is higlighted by more of Halford's amazing vocals backed by Tipton and Downing's power driving riffs and the rhythm section of Ian and Dave also help drive this song pefectly throughout. The song also featues yet another memorable chorus and some great soloing as well. This song is definitely one of my favorite Judas Priest songs for sure.\n\nMoving on, we have track six and another one of my favorites \"Solar Angels\" which includes more strong riffing from the duo of Tipton and Downing throughout including a very chunky opening riff and also features some really nice soaring yet melodic solo flights, plus there's some great sci-fi lyrics and more great vocals from Halford on here as well. Track nine \"Troubleshooter\" is also another one of my favorite songs on here that anchors yet more excellent rocking riffs and leads as well as some great bass work and drumming, plus more great vocals from Halford and another nice, catchy chorus, and some nice soloing as well. The album's closer \"On the Run\" is a great album closer (which is also another thing that Priest does well besides album openers) that showcases more of Halford's amazing vocal deliveries including some real killer high notes, and the song also features some more great riffing from Glenn and K.K. along with a great driving rhythm courtesy of Ian and Dave that will just kick you straight to the ground. We're also treated with a pair of bonus cuts on here with the first one being \"Thunder Road\" which was recorded during the 1988 \"Ram It Down\" sessions, and it's a great song, and we also have a great live version of \"Desert Plains\" which was recorded in '86 and is also more faster paced than the original studio version as well.\n\nIn every sense of the word, \"Point of Entry\" is unquestionably one of the more overlooked and underrated gems in Judas Priest's discography for an album that was put out in between two monumental classics in 1980's \"British Steel\" and 1982's \"Screaming For Vengeance\", and yes despite being more melodic and laid back and having a more 70's rock sound even though this album was put out in 1981, but it is still a very high quality sounding album and if you're a fan of Judas Priest through and through, \"Point of Entry is definitely worth every penny...Recommended!!!

I will say however that it is challenging, which is exactly what I look for in a game, that and a high fun factor.  And man is this game fun. I mean who wants a game they can beat or run through in one sitting?  Onto to the review:\n\nGraphics: 5 out 0f 5 simply amazing I knew the PSP had it in her.  Killzone in my opinion really push the graphics envelope.  Graphically I can't honestly name another game that looks better.  The Birds eye view of the combat is great.  For you main characters to be so small in bird's eye view they hole a lot of detail.  Games on the PSP can look amazing and this game proves it.\n\nSound: 4.5 out 5 the game sounds great!!! The voice over are well done!! Battle cries/sounds are wonderful.  To hear Rico shouting Obscenities and talking trash to the combatants can get old sometimes, but it is still more hilarious than tedious listening to him talk trash.\n\nControls/Gameplay 4 out of 5 Okay this is where most people and even I ran into some issues with Killzone: L. But honestly there was more right than there was wrong with the controls and battle mechanics.  Okay first the targeting system has the highest learning curve but once you have mastered it this game is a breeze.  Your main character Capt Templar automatically targets any enemy that he is facing and in range.  Holding the right shoulder button allows Templar to duck and cover, problem here, that I wish was different was that you cannot move while you are crouched (this did suck, but very easy to forgive).  Holding the right and left shoulder buttons target an inanimate destroyable target (like fuel carrying barrels to destroy enemies.  Also while ducking behind cover you can tap the shoot button if you are targeting an enemy and you will auto pop up to take shots at him.  This game throws a lot at you like spiderbombs, guys with rocket launchers and grenades, but all can be avoided with practice and a simple double tap of the left shoulder button.  Overall the good definitely outweigh the bad, and you will become addicted to this style of Gameplay IF you take time to learn the controls, which unfortunately have a very high learning curve to some.\n\nStory (So Far) 3 out of 5, the story is really lacking though it is very simplistic and also indicates a KL2 in the future.  It doesn't suck but it is definitely not enough to keep a hardcore gamer interested, but luckily the addictive Gameplay makes up for it.\n\nBottom Line: If you are looking for a challenging game, with good graphics and a style of gameplay that hasn't been done in awhile, probably since the first Metal Gear.  Then I highly recommend this game...once I got the hang of the controls I was addicted and could not stop playing it.  The campaign modes are not too short but not very long either and the bonus missions will test your skills for hours.", "I had unscrewed my washing machine hoses, took out, and then cleaned the filters.

I believe that music can make the difference between a good movie and a bad movie in most cases (some movies are too dumb for even a good composer to save) and although I think Raiders of the Lost Ark is a good movie by itself, John Williams' excellent score makes it that much better!  It fits perfectly with the movie in every way!\nI do have to admit that I'm not a big fan of John Williams' style, but can anyone deny that this is a good score?  I hope not!  The main theme is exciting and adventuresome (if a lot like the Williams style that I'm not that fond of) and the London Symphony Orchestra (has Mr. Williams ever used anything else?) is fantastic.  Probably my favorite part of this score is what the liner notes call the \"Ark theme.\"  It's very eerie and the total opposite of the main theme.

Thanks Numi", "Two year old granddaughter is making Pizza, learning to count the pieces of pizza, and the pepperoni, mushrooms, etc.", "Well, what can I say about this game that hasn't been said already? Nothing really. The previous reviews really sum it up nicely. I've been a Metal Gear fan since I first played a demo for MGS and a PS demo disc that my local Pizza Hut was giving away. And I could not even tell you how many times I played through that very brief demo.\n\n\"Tactical Espionage Action\" is the basis of all MGS games and people looking for a rootin tootin shoot em up game had best look elsewhere, I urge you to consider this is a stealth game, a bit more action oriented than Splinter Cell games but never the less mostly the point is to sneak by unnoticed as opposed to killing everything in sight, in fact in all MGS games you have the option of going through the game with no kills and will be rewarded for it in someway. Although there is one of the most amazing arrays of weaponry I've ever seen, featured in this game you really don't want to use them too much. Most of these weapons are customizable as well, lazer sights, fore grips, grenade launchers, scopes etc... But I doubt you'll really need much of them. I'm well used to MGS games and the re release of MGS3 (subsistance) had me pretty well prepared for the camera controls.\nSince we're on the subject of stealth, I would really like to touch on the subject of OCTO CAMO which is Snakes sneaking suit that blends in with whatever wall you may be leaning against or floor you may be laying down on. Also, if you see a statue with an empty space beside it you can actually pose and blend with the statue while enemies mosey on by unaware. Which is just neato.\n\nThis game was the reason I finally broke down and got a PS3 because I just couldn't stand not having played this game yet and I was a very latecomer to it. I've only had it for, as of the time of this writing, less than a month and I've played through it a half dozen times and really the game play doesn't get old and there's lots of different difficulty settings to try and over all it's just got a great replay value.\n\nThe story, the story unfolds not really in any cinematic way, mainly because we don't have 15 hour movies, but it more or less unfolds like a really good Stephen King mini series. It still has the rotten MOCAP that makes characters in the cutscenes look all floaty and silly but that's nothing unique since most games use MOCAP (Motion Capture, in case you didn't know) these days, I don't know, I imagine they use this to cut down on spending time animating every individual cutscene, but I'm not really an expert on the whole behind the scenes of video games stuff. The way the characters move around, aside, the cutscenes are every bit as entertaining as a Tony Scott film and as visual as a Ridley Scott film. Of course it's very self referential but if it is to be the final chapter then they did well to have so many characters from the previous games in it.\n\nThe real meat of this title, and any other game worth playing is the gameplay. Which has the perfect balance of familiarity with the controls while not just being a reiteration of MGS3:S. Every thing is streamlined and refined to make figuring out the controls really easy both for vets and newbs to the series. It's really fun sneaking through a massive battle unnoticed while snipers take out guys just feet away from you and mortar shells are landing all around you. The stamina gauge established in MGS2 has been reworked into a psyche gauge and there's also a combat stress system ie. Snake gets stressed out when he's laying prone in the middle of a battlefield and there some guy firing a mounted machine gun in his direction which leads to his psyche gauge dropping and which causes his aiming to become sloppy or his camo index to drop. Relieve the stress, smoke some cigarettes (smoking's, bad kids), read a playboy (no nudity in this game, just scantily clad women), listen to your iPod (yes, Snake has an iPod... IDK WTF), hide in a box or just go find some nice quiet corner out of the sun and hide there for a while. It's really not as complicated as it sounds.\nI mentioned the massive amount of firepower this game is packing and if you chose to you can use it all quite easily. I mainly go with a silenced sniper rifle to pick off foes at a distance, if need be. But, amongst other things Solid Snake, or Old Snake as he's referred to in this game now has the CQC system that was set up in MGS3, this too has been streamlined into optimum efficiency and ease of use (controls).\n\nGraphically, I've never seen a better video game, some of the visuals in this game really did strike me with a bit of awe. The cut scenes are detailed and in some cases interactive.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing accomplishment in video games, anyone who likes the MGS series; this is a must have for you. For people new to or wholly unfamiliar with it I would really recommend playing the previous games<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Metal-Gear-Solid-The-Essential-Collection/dp/B001383L36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection</a>&nbsp;first.

I believe that most skin enhancing results are gained through a healthy diet, sufficient sleep and limiting stress, accompanied by a simple cleansing routine that doesn't strip your natural pH, a gentle exfoliating strategy, and regular application of sun sunscreen. This was sent as a sample for reviewing purposes and I have been using it twice a day after my skin cleansing and toning routine. I might mention, in reviewing another topical product, a similarly priced toner, some months ago, I came to the conclusion that it was a very good product, but just obscenely priced for what it accomplished and gave it a correspondingly medium rating. Normally, skin seems to need to acclimate to a new product and then it takes weeks if not months to see any results, since it's the skin that repairs itself. A product only usually assists in removing the top dead skin cells and offering some rehydration to keep the cells protected and plump. That being said, after barely 2 weeks, I see  a noticeable difference in my skin, It seems more even and balanced and subtly youthful. Enough so, that I decided to write this review now instead of waiting 5 or 6 weeks as I imagined would be necessary. I can't see how much its being depleted, but if it lasts anywhere near the 8 weeks it says it might last, I will purchase it again. I might mention that I regularly experiment with every type of facial acid, toners and oils like emu and even make my own vitamin C serum with ferulic acid. This SkinMedica hydrator has offered the most rapid and noticeable results. It's still very expensive which is disheartening, but especially for older or dry skin, it seems so far to be offering noticeable results.", "dated, but stil a great chic flic to watch with your girlfriends on a chilly winter night.

Karigan G'ladheon has faced life threatening challenges since she ran away from bullies at her boarding school and I can't help but cheer for her.\n\nThe lands of Sacoridia are bounded by magical  D'Yer Wall that has stood for a thousand years.  It has served to keep the nightmare creatures of Kanmorhan Vane out, but  the Gray One has breached the wall.  I had hoped that the wall would be more involved in this story, but that comes in future books.  The Green Riders are the main theme.  They are the legendary couriers of the lands, though their reputation has tarnished over the centuries and their role in the liberation from evil has been forgotten.\n\nThis book has many of the features I look for in a good book.  A strong female character, a good cast to support her, magic that keeps me guessing and a wonderful setting.  The land of Sacoridia is realistic in many ways, yet the possibility of magic adds numerous twists.  I had one problem with this created world. The road that Karigan travels from school to the capital city is impossibly long compared to those travelled by he father.  Unfortunately there is no map of the lands included in the book, so I have to imagine that the route she took was the 'milk run' that passed through all the out of the way towns.\n\nKarigan does a lot of growing up in this coming of age story.  From school girl to respected Green Rider, she faces challenges that might have thwarted vastly more experienced adults.  True to form for a teenager, she says she wants travel and adventure and then when she's presented with it, all she wants to go is go home.\n\nI first read this book shortly after it was published in 1998 and I feel that it still reads well for a debut novel.

White's account of the rise and fall of King Arthur, he reveals very quickly and with little hesitation that he is retelling the tale from La Morte d'Arthur by Thomas Mallory.  Obviously, Mallory's account is perhaps the more encompassing and reliable as it comes to Arthurian legend, as it commands a status of source material to many later works.  Moreover, Mallory's novel certainly divulges and explains most if not all of the life and exploits of King Arthur, which White admits that he does not.  If all this is true, it raises the very distinct question, why would White retell a tale in part?  The answer comes across very clearly for those who have read The Once and Future King: to animate it and breathe life into characters that live only within the realm of historical fiction depicted by Mallory.  La Morte d'Arthur gives the life of Arthur; The Once and Future King, instead, gives life TO Arthur--and for that matter, every character to appear within the text.\nFor that reason--and to say the very least--this book is one about characters, not about events or wars or places or times or even the philosophical debate that tears apart the protagonist's mind.  It is instead about discovering the intricacies of character and exploring their motivations through all of their psychological complexities. To read through The Once and Future King is to discover the most intricately fleshed out, diverse, and imaginative characters ever to grace the page of a novel: Arthur's righteousness, Lancelot's self-deprecation, Quenevere's indecisiveness, the Torment of the sons of Morgause.  No man or woman in this novel is a villain, nor is he a hero, lest he is a hero and villain to his own self.  And for all those reasons, this novel excels beyond a simple depiction of medieval Knights and chivalry; it is the lives of men as they struggle with wrong, in pursuit of the illusive and ill-defined right, in pursuit of civilization.\nIntermingled, however, is a mastery of story telling.  It is a fascinating experience, witnessing the meek Wart of \"The Sword in the Stone\" turn into the great humanitarian King that created peace, created Lawfulness, and then watched as it all crumbled around him. So complex is the interaction of plot and character, that this is necessarily a novel fraught with intrigue and rediscovery.  Whether you know the tales of Arthur or not, you will discover something new and interesting with every adventure; something new not just in the adventure, but in the man himself.\nAnd so, if one where to decide whether or not to read White or Mallory in their pursuit of Arthurian legend, it comes down to the simple question: Do you want to know about the history of Arthur, or Arthur himself?  White's novel is no doubt more pleasing, because it covers a diverse host of individuals and all the elaborate intricacies of their relationships.  It is truly a experiment in character study that still never fails to appeal on all levels.  The story, the accounts, the psychology of it all is a thrilling endeavor, and one that no book lover should miss.  This is the tale of King Arthur at its most human, its most intense, the way the King would be in the flesh.", "genuine APC", "A real classic rock song, American Pie is probably one of the longest songs from its era.

While it has its limitations - lack of a good zoom, anemic flash and hard-to-see viewfinder, it takes great pictures and is exceptionally easy to tote around.  I have not used the highest resolution mode and have been quite satisfied with 8X10 prints printed on my HP 890 or sent to Ofoto.  The panorama mode can produce spectacular results and by the way is an easy way around the limitations of the camera's 2.1 megapixel resolution.  If you play around with the size of your panoramas, you  can print pictures larger than 8X10 that will be as sharp as your 8X10's.  If you don't have a large format printer, use a printing service for that special photo.  I have been blown away by the instant feedback I get from a digital camera and the Elph has made photography a lot more fun.  Often, it's the only camera I carry, but I still lug around an APS SLR with a big zoom when I'm doing serious photography.  I have been rather surprised how well some hand-held night shots come out.  I've gotten pictures at dusk that are reasonably sharp and show much more detail than I would expect from the camera's ISO 100 rating.  It is essential to have a second battery as your battery will always run out when you need it.  I use Lexar CF cards, they come with a USB cable and transfer pictures 3x faster than the camera.  Set the camera in \"manual\" mode, which is still basically automatic, as it allows you to choose all the flash modes available.  In addition, set the camera to remember the last settings or you will have to put it into manual mode each time you turn it on.  Unlike a lot of digital cameras on the market, the Elph is easy to use and carry and feels like a camera.  Its menus are a little complex but people who don't find features that are there and complain about difficulty of use just haven't studied the manual.  I have recommended the camera to my friends on this basis:  in 5 years it will be obsolete but it will still fit in your pocket and you will still be using it for snapshots.", "This is a very upbeat praise song.

As to the more substantive errors, how long the heroine has been a widow type of thing and whether the white dress changes to black as she moves from the first floor to the second, I just 'pass on by' without noticing, or caring if I do notice. For me, this is light entertainment, pure escapism, if you will, at a bargain price, made possible, in part, by the absence of careful scrutiny which would add to the cost of the product. My advice to any reader who is bothered by these things, is to purchase only books issued by main-line publishing houses and pay the extra dollars for the salaries of professional editors and proof readers.\nAll of which is simply to say, my review is not a guide to be relied on by someone for whom these things matter in reading this kind of book.\nAs to the book itself, I found it to be pleasingly diverting from the cares of the day, sufficiently entertaining to maintain my interest throughout. It is not Ellery Queen or Agatha Christie, not innovative in plot or setting, but quite competitive with the average cozy appearing on Kindle. The heroine, a widow, is in the first week of opening a new lodge set up with a mystery writing theme; the first group of guests is comprised of mystery book writers, with the host being their agent. In a not exactly novel plot device, there occurs a major snowstorm which brings with it murder and a major need for the heroine to call upon her extended family and her friends to manage the emergency and to cope with the crime (her brother is the Sheriff). With the guests, the permanent and temporary staff, and the police, to work with, the author is able to construct an interesting set of interrelationships and a sufficiency of clues to keep us involved to the end.

We are new to the Thomas TV series but I believe Annie and Clarabel originally started out with lighter colored roofs until they were revamped in 2013.  Since Thomas needs his coaches, if you want to save a few bucks this version will do just fine.", "Doom is a very good first person shooter and next to wolf3D it is the greatest game ever made. Wolf3D is the grand daddy of morden 3D games but it was Doom which made the world sit and take notice. Without Doom there would be no multiplayer tournaments, I think doom is the game which started the multiplayer games with co-operative and deathmatch gameplay. You play a soldier sent to another planet to destroy the aliens and save the world, The gameplay is very good and the controls are very easy to use. The length of all the games are very good. Finally i think an OpenGL patch for Doom called GLDoom was made by a gamer using the doom source code. I read that on the net a long time ago. They could have included that patch in this edition.

It provided so many hours of fun - and easy-to-learn, hard-to-master pick-up-and-play classic, with amazing graphics and a masterful 4-player mode.  And here is the sequel, Tennis 2K2, which takes the basic formula of the first game and expands upon it, and the result is not only an improvement, but an altogether better game.\nSega added the game to its already excellent Sega Sports line, and as a result, the gameplay is more of a simulation than the arcadey Virtua Tennis.  In addition, there are now sixteen licensed players, from Patrick Rafter to Jelena Dokic.  The players look unbelievably realistic, down to the smallest detail.  Monica Seles makes her trademark grunts, Tim Henman hitches his shoulders while he serves, Lindsay Davenport has her familiar racket windup, etc etc.  It's almost eerie how true to life the players are - a vast improvement over the rather grotesque characters from the first game.  There are now 28 courts, a HUGE addition over Virtua Tennis, and some of them are just gorgeous.  The Rio court at dusk is particularly wonderous, giving the court and players a glow that's magnificent to behold.\nThe gameplay, while similar to VT, has undergone a few changes, making the game much more challenging.  You now have three types of shots: topspin, slice, and lob.  There is also much more attention paid to how powerful the shots are in relation to how close the player is to the ball, i.e. if the ball is close to you when you swing, you're not going to hit it very hard.  Positioning your player in order to get maximum shot power and control is vital, adding a whole layer of strategy to the game.  Thankfully, the too-often diving of the first game has been practically eliminated, as players lunge for balls just out of reach.  If you should dive, however, you jump back to your feet in no time - a much-welcome improvement.  You can also return serves with much more power, if you're in the right place.  This makes the game more balanced, as the server was usually victorious in Virtua Tennis.  The players have much more range now, which results in longer, more strategic matches.  You cannot jump into Tennis 2K2 and expect victory right away if you've mastered VT - it's necessary to learn the subtle details all over again.  Despite these new complexities, the game still retains the same charm and playability of the original.  Credit Sega for not just re-releasing Virtua Tennis with new graphics - T2K2 is a much different, but no less enjoyable game. The best thing about the improved gameplay is it gives you more control over your player and his/her shots.\nTournament (arcade) and Exhibition modes are, in fact, set up the same as VT:  pick a player (or players) and hit the courts.  There is a mixed doubles option, as you cannot play two males against two females.  However, the World Circuit Mode has seen some pretty drastic changes.  You create a male and female player using rather limited options, and start training in your quest to become #1 in the world (you start ranked at 300th).  You follow a 12-month calendar, on which different singles and doubles matches are displayed for you to enter.  In between matches, you train your players using different trials, much like the first game, but instead of winning money, you improve your player's statistics in various categories (forehand power, foot speed, serve control, etc.).  These training matches have the same unusual charm as VT's:  you'll try to knock items off a conveyer belt to improve your serve, try to catch flags while avoiding being hit by balls fired from tennis machines, and even play a strange tennis version of Othello.  These quirky minigames are just as wonderful and addictive as before, and Bulls' Eye and Pin Crasher make repeat appearances. It's very necessary to train, as your players begin basically at zero and will lose matches immediately unless you train.  When you think you're ready, you can enter a match.  If you win, you get money, which you can then spend in the various shops for doubles partners, additional outfits, racket upgrades, and more arenas for Exhibition Mode.  You also improve your rank, imperative as you must have a certain rank in order to enter higher tournaments.  These changes are, again, intended to make the game more of a simulation than an arcade experience, but it's set up in such an intuitive and compelling way that it's more enjoyable.  You'll get attached to your created players quickly, and you can even use them in the game's other modes.\nTennis 2K2 is a gorgeous-to-look-at masterpiece that has even deeper gameplay than the original, and is unmatched as a multiplayer party game and as a single-player experience.  It is a must-own classic that is the final hurrah for the dying Dreamcast, and is one of the system's top three games.

Gregg gave the voice of \"everyman\" who can identify.

The elastic strap around the front is really nice for keeping the pages secure and safe.  Also I really enjoy the ribbon that keeps me on the right page and I don't have to flip through the book looking for the last page I wrote on.

The 10-bearings make this a really smooth and quiet reel, and the anti-reverse, live bait feeder, and drag have worked flawlessly. I use the EB-50 for my Chesapeake chumming rod with 17# mono, and the EB-65 for a 12' ocean surf rod with 50# braided line. I probably should have purchased the Coronado version for my surf rod, since Coronados have the same bait feeder feature but are specifically designed to resist saltwater, but I religiously flush my tackle with fresh water after every outing, and after 6 years see no corrosion, even on the surf outfit.\n\nEpixor reels come with an additional spool (without the titanium lip the first reel has) which comes in handy if you need to switch to a different line type or weight. I particularly like the bait feeder lever which not only allows you to fish live bait without resistance or an open bail, but also really comes in handy just in lowering your bottom rig to the right height when you're trying to rebait a long surf stick standing in a sand spike.\n\nMy only real complaint about the Okumas is that the finish on the Epixor reels could be more durable. I'm a pretty meticulous person in taking care of my gear, yet somehow the silver, painted finish has chipped in a few places on both reels, or line has cut through it when it accidentally wrapped around the bale pivot. Not really a biggie, but not something I see on my American-made reels. But hey, for all of the other features at this price, I can live with a few dings.

Barbra gives definitive renditions of the French classics \"Autumn Leaves,\" \"Clopin Clopant,\" \"Speak To Me Of Love,\" and the breathtaking \"Once Upon A Summertime.\"  The lessor-known material (\"What Now My Love,\" \"I Wish You Love\") is just as good, with \"Free Again\" (which had been performed in French as \"Non C'est Rien\" on Color Me Barbra) standing strong as one of her most amazing vocal performances.  The disc also finds Barbra composing her first melody (\"Ma Premiere Chanson,\" which showcases her considerable writing talent in it's early stages), as well as tackling a song that was originally written for Edith Piaf (\"Le Mer\"), on which Streisand really excels.

I can't completely blame them; after all, certain magazines (such as Game Informer) seem to throw any semblance of journalistic integrity out the window in their quest to write slavishly glowing and obsequious previews and reviews of any games from GTA's developers, Rockstar Games.  These publications make it seem that there are no other worthwhile games out there aside from the GTA games, to such a degree that it almost screams payola.  Or does it?\n\n  By this point, you probably are familiar with the Grand Theft Auto premise, established by Grand Theft Auto 3 in 2001.  You control a criminally inclined character in a city, who can take a variety of missions from characters scattered about the area, and can pretty much take over most any vehicle.  While there is a storyline in the game, you are allowed a significant amount of freedom, to the point where you can choose to not take any story missions, and instead either take on minor side missions, or simply drive about and cause chaos.  GTA 3's sequel, Vice City, was the beneficiary of relentless media hype arising from the swell of unexpected success from its predecessor.  While it boasted a number of improvements, such as better graphics, a great licensed soundtrack, a more cinematic storyline (complete with celebrity voice acting), somewhat better targeting, and the addition of motorcycles and helicopters, Vice City was really not the quantum leap in gaming it was billed as.  Not only did it fail to correct some of the failings of GTA 3, but it also took a step backwards in environmental design, as Vice City's flashy '80s neon cool couldn't make up for its flat and boring design (as opposed to Liberty City's multi-tiered, busy design).\n\n  When the hype over the next Grand Theft Auto game began to build, my reaction was more of a \"so what\"?  Sure, I loved the GTA Double Pack (and had originally played a fair portion of Vice City on the PS2), but did I really need another stint in a small city, pursuing the same kind of missions and mayhem as before?  However, when I found out the true scope of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, my interest grew exponentially.\n\n  GTA: San Andreas is certainly one of the most ambitious action games I've ever seen.  Instead of providing one mere city, this game provides an entire state, albeit a relatively small and abridged one (when compared to the real thing).  Three very distinct cities (based on Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas), a dozen small towns, a mountain, desert, woods, prairie, farms, rivers- this game's environment is the definition of \"throwing in the kitchen sink\".  The number of missions has increased from the prior installments' 60-odd missions to over 100 story/side-story missions, plus the \"career\" missions (vigilante, ambulance, firefighter, valet, trucker, pimp, burglar, etc.), and the inevitable racing challenges.  If that's not enough, several \"just for kicks\" mini-games are included, such as pool, basketball free-throws, and arcade games.  But wait- there's more!  The variety of vehicles has once again increased, and now includes a selection of \"proper\" airplanes (including a fighter jet!), ATVs, and mountain bikes, in addition to cars, boats, motorcycles, and helicopters.\n\n  Beyond these changes, the gameplay mechanics have been kicked up a notch.  Your character, Carl Johnson, can now not only swim, but can also climb over fences if needed.  In a move unheralded in the series, the developers threw in RPG elements: the more you perform an action (running, firing a certain weapon, driving), the higher your related skill stats go.  You can customize your character to a certain degree (haircuts, individual clothing items), affect your characters physique by eating and working out, and even have a few girlfriends (who you can go on dates with).  Targeting has also been improved, with the addition of a new manual aim mechanic for all projectile weapons, and a fully controllable camera.  At several points in the game, you'll also get to lead your own posse of gang members, and engage in territorial conflict.\n\n  The storyline this time around is a little less tongue in cheek, and a little bit more serious.  You control Carl Johnson, a former gang member, who is dragged back into the lifestyle by an unexpected death in the family.  Even if you were never into the \"Boyz In The Hood\" genre of melodrama, the game is so well executed, and expands so far beyond that conceit, that it's hard not to be drawn in.  (The downside is that this game may hit too close to home for anyone in a neighborhood terrorized by gang violence and the resulting \"collateral damage\".)  The true breadth of the game really hits you when you first drive beyond the Los Santos city limits, into the countryside of Red County.  Not only is there variety to be found in the three general country areas bordering the cities, but each of the three big cities is distinct from the others.  Los Santos (the Los Angeles clone) combines the sun-drenched, beachcomber vibe of Vice City with the gritty sprawl of the L.A. seen in Quentin Tarentino and John Singleton movies, and the elevated highway interchanges and lofty downtown metropolitan look of more decadent depictions of the West Coast.  San Fierro's (the fake San Francisco) vertical inclines and polished architecture come off as a more genteel, pleasant version of Liberty City.  While the Las Vegas-inspired Las Venturas sports the weakest layout of the cities, being too reminiscent of Vice City's flat, low-rise tract design, its neon-lit casinos, scattered industrial depots and encircling highway system provide their own charms.\n\n  For the Xbox version, there's the good...and the bad.  One of the greatest improvements is the inclusion of custom soundtracks.  As huge as the included soundtrack is, I feel that Vice City's '80s soundtrack is better, and I'm not much of a fan of rap or grunge (I do sort of like the New Jack Swing station).  The ability to make my own soundtrack is key for a game which depends a lot on cruising around; King Crimson, Deep Purple, Angra, The Four Tops, and more make the experience more unpredictable and just more fun.  The graphics are improved in that the draw distance is better, textures are a bit nicer, and the almost-overwhelming orange glow present in the PS2 version has been toned down.  However, the cool car reflections of the PS2 version are MIA, for some reason.  In general, the graphics are not as shiny and \"clean\" as the Xbox version of Vice City, but do seem to provide more detail and variety (even if in a somewhat grainier fashion). Controls are a similar mixed bag; while the Xbox control sticks are a sight better for targeting, the controls for \"drive-by shooting\" are abysmal, compared to the GTA Double Pack (why the change?).\n\n  This game is so huge in scope that you'll find yourself playing for 70 or more hours, whether engaged in the more elaborate missions (which involve such diverse objectives as chasing a train, framing a DA, infiltrating a military base, a high speed mid-air dog fight, and even an assassination in far away Liberty City!), betting on the horse races, or in just exploring the huge environment.  It's true that the \"open world\" genre is no longer new and enough in itself, with competition from Saint's Row, Just Cause, and True Crime: NYC.  However, while those games may have better graphics, or a more refined targeting system, none of them has the depth of gameplay, variety and attention to environmental design as this game.  For once, the hype was right.  They finally made a game that feels almost as immersive as an actual world, but without as many limitations.

It's very entertaining, but the subject matter and context of the violence [of which there is plenty] is better for a \"less impressionable\" mind.)", "This is by far her best album.

It's a beginner set so it has has the necessary items he needs for now.", "The third of the well-received \"Fatal Frame\" series carries on all the same gameplay as it's predecessors, but as the idea has proved to be such a good one, there's nothing wrong with that. Playing as a young female reporter called Rei - the most grown-up main character seen so far in the series - the player is once again armed with a ghost-busting camera and sent to explore a huge dilapidated Japanese mansion. And once again you will encounter vengeful phantoms that need to be dispatched via split-second timing of getting the best possible shots with the mysterious camera. This aspect is as fun as ever, as the best shots always come with the cost of putting yourself at most risk in order to take them (i.e. letting the ghost come as near as possible to attacking you). Also back are the many fleeting apparitions that you need to be lightning quick with your shutter-finger to snap on film. But it's all worth the effort, as these shots, along with your best \"attack\" photos score highly on a points system that lets you power up the capabilities of the camera, turning it into a more powerful ghost-buster for the later, harder phantoms...especially when it's sometimes not just one against one.\n\nI had reservations as the game got underway, when I realised that all the spooky Japanese mansions were starting to get a bit repetitive, with the same old rotting cupboards and dusty kimonos at every corner, but the game has addressed this with a new slant on the gameplay, in that all the ghost hunting levels forms part of a recurring nightmare being experienced by main character. When she's not dreaming, she's awake and inhabiting her not-at-all spooky apartment. This splitting of playing time between dream trips to the forbidding mansion, and popping into the neat and tidy kitchen or stroking the cat, reminded me heavily of \"Silent Hill 4\", which used the same dual locations, and must have been an inspiration for this game. Cleverly, the game has Rei being up and about in her own apartment between both day and night times, and after the horrors of the dream adventures, even this neat and modern location begins to make you fell uneasy when walking around it at night. There are also two more playable characters in the game which adds variety, as they can go into areas that Rei cannot access. They also have certain unique skills, but much weaker ghost-busting cameras than Rei, so these stages can be tough. And once again those evil ghosts are no slouches, and getting the \"fatal frame\" shots can be pretty dicey, especially as these ghouls don't play fair and can vanish and teleport all over the place while you are swinging your camera around trying to keep them in view....you'll learn to hate those little girls with stakes and mallets!\n\nBecause of the fun to be had with the camera and the game in general, I'm prepared to once again forgive the same drawbacks that are still present as before - really clunky directional controls and the lamest \"run\" function ever witnessed - Rei runs like a little old lady hobbling after a bus. Despite starting off as a fairly easy game, the game keeps the reputation of the series up by occasionally throwing some really tough ghost battles at you, roundabout the halfway mark and onwards, so save often! Even so, the ghosts STILL don't live up to the creepy horrors of the first game (too many of the ghosts are smiling little girls, which doesn't scare me very much), but I think that this third installment actually has the most grown up theme; it's take on the rituals concerning death and the afterlife is handled very seriously and quite sensitively. It also has the most impressive ending movie of the series so far - effective and quite moving. Bottom line - while not really being very different to parts one and two, this is a worthy third installment to the series, and a treat for fans.", "My husband uses this, and he seems to like it.

After using it for about 1.5 months, I have found that it does deliver on its promise to provide mascara without clumps.  So far the mascara has stayed fresh and well lubricated inside the tube, so when I withdraw the mascara wand it glides out smoothly without any clumps or crusty bits.  The mascara wand is made of a plastic material with short spikes, which I believe helps provide the clump-free application experience.\n\nI purchased the water resistant version of this mascara.  It has proven to hold up to high humidity in the last couple months of summer, as well as watery eyes from allergies.  Unlike some truly waterproof mascaras, I haven't had to scrub my eyelashes raw to remove it at the end of the day either.\n\nAlong with the positives, to make this a truly outstanding product I would improve its volumization properties.  It does not provide much volume or length to my lashes at all.  I assume that the ingredients in other mascaras that provide those qualities may also lend themselves to clumping however, which is likely why this CoverGirl formula can't provide both clump-free application as well as making my lashes thicker and longer.  Overall I am pleased with my purchase but am unsure whether I would purchase again at full price, given that I want thicker, longer lashes more than I need a clump-free application experience.", "Bought this to take my xbox games on a trip. be warned though, on the inside cover there are slots for the disks, instead of a full 72 slots on the page things.", "Great price and great performance.

From the reviews, we thought this might be good enough to get by, and we figured it would save us half or more over enough ordinary-sized tubs from Sam's Club (which we love for almost everything).  So we took the risk and ordered two cases.\n\nJust before the event, our local Greek restaurant owner, who was supplying the fresh pita for us at wholesale, asked what we were doing for hummus.  We kicked ourselves, realizing she would probably have given us a deal on their fabulous hummus, too.  How stupid were we to have bought a mix already?\n\nShe smiled sympathetically when we explained, but then said that they themselves had sometimes had to take shortcuts when they had an unexpected run on their supply.  She said, \"follow directions, but add your own fresh garlic, tahini and extremely good extra virgin olive oil, and you'll be fine.\"\n\nSo, we did.  The results were absolutely stellar.  We had raves for our hummus, with everyone asking for the recipe.\n\nWe had a few extra boxes afterwards, so we've made it one box at a time since then, using the same formula.  Still sensational.  And what a price break, even with the extra cost of the tiny amount of tahini, garlic and olive oil!\n\nBy the way:  it takes a little while to stir this enough to dissolve the mix thoroughly.  An ordinary whisk works beautifully.  We find that refrigerating it after mixing, ideally for several hours but even if just for an hour or so, makes a huge difference.  It's now a staple in our house.  (If only we could find a way to get really good pita without having to bother our restaurateur friends!)\n\nUPDATE:  I see that Amazon is suspending shipment of this product (although it's available from other suppliers).  Don't know what the problem was.  We just got 2 cases recently, and they came from 2 different Amazon distribution centers, all with no problem at all.

Otherwise, they seemed like a decent pair of binoculars for the price - just not for me.", "Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" was for me hard to put down for the first 100 pages but even harder to pick up again for the rest of the book. When I started reading I was delighted (and scared) to find exactly what I had hoped for: not just a story of horror and vampires, but a subtle tale of psychological tension between the main character and his terrifying but sophisticated and intriguing host.\nIt wasn't without surprise that I then saw the story suddenly turn into something else altogether as it left the setting of the claustrophobic rooms of Dracula's castle for the more pedestrian environment of Victorian England. At this point the Count almost completely disappears from the story and we are left with a number of extremely flat, templated characters moving through a corny Victorian drama.\nAt many stages, as I saw a character start a sentence with \"Oh dear, dear Madam Mina, for the love that we all feel for you...\" I immediately skipped through piles of Victorian filler fluff to the next period.\n\nWhat really bothered me in the second act of the story, however, is the superficially rational but ultimately goofy behaviour of the characters. Good narrators have their plot develop through the acumend of their characters who always find the smart next move in the chess game against their adversary. Bad narrators rely on the continuous blunders of both heroes and villains to make the story move in the desired direction. Errors, after all, are much easier to come up with than brilliant ideas. Where would spy movies be without villains who waste their chance to kill off James Bond and reveal him their plot instead? Or without air conducts from which conspirators can be easily eaves-dropped?\n\n[SPOILERS FOLLOW]\nIn the case of this book, the level of stupidity in the characters' decision making almost breaks the suspension of disbelief, especially considering the apparently methodical intelligence through which at least one of them (Van Helsing) uses vague clues to formulate complex plots.\nAs soon as it was mentioned that vampires cannot enter a house if not invited first by someone, I immediately wondered why the character had taken residence in the same building  as a mental patient whom they knew was under the influence of Dracula. Inevitably, not many pages later, this proves almost fatal to their efforts. And why not place crucifixes and garlic everywhere in their house and always carry some on their persons? This, too, proved to be a major blunder congenial to plot development.\nBut the real champion of goofiness in the book is Count Dracula, a demi-God with immense powers, unlimited time and the advantage of surprise, who somehow manages to do just about everything that would have been necessary for a company of four men and a woman to identify him as a vampire, discover his cove, chase him from London and eventually track him and kill him. Why would Dracula wish to kidnap and kill on Harker, the person who was meant to arrange his move to London? Once there someone would have certainly suspected something of the last person known to have seen him alive. Once he has escaped and is ready to expose the secret, why concentrate - for no purpose and without any intention on Dracula's part - most of his business on Harker's circle of friends (his first victim the best friend of his fiancee, his residence next to her doctor's, his henchman-wannabe one of his patients), so that traces upon traces are left, clues pile up and he is discovered? Wouldn't a recently emigrated, not well established vampire wish to keep a lower profile for a while at least? Especially one who is described as a being of high intelligence and a successulf strategist.\n\nFinally, the narrative device of diaries entries used to narrate the story towards the end - which served the suspense so well in the beginning when it was just Johnatan Harker narrating the events in Dracula's castle - becomes slightly forced as the characters seem to spend just as much time during the day chasing Dracula as they do writing surprisingly accurate accounts of the events in their spare time, even when they recently escaped grave danger or when presumably they would have better things to do. Once again, the story-telling device that worked so well in the first act eventually gets in the way of credibility when the scenario changes.", "Important Comment: The manual that comes with the unit is not THE manual. The full manual is on line. e.g. When you set the start time, the number indicator is for one of four start times per day. It is NOT the station number. All stations run consecutively on every start time if a duration is set. This is in the full manual not the manual shipped with the unit. As a result, I almost threw this thing away when it ran 16 times on one day on one program! But the fine print sent me on-line to get the thing to work. The comments on the orbit web site are that this is a non intuitive device! End of important comment. Looks good so far, easy enough to program though you should keep THE manual. Operations is not at all intuitive unless you already owned one of these. Some buttons have two labels (enter/manual). You have to cycle through modes to get to the mode you want (e.g. manual water individual stations.) But, if you just try them all, you will find what you want sooner or later. I took off one star for the non-intuitive interface. This is an outdoor controller. Thus it limits the openings to the controller. That is good. But installing it is a bear. I am a grown man. Trying to get my adult fingers in the sideways crook to access the common left me cursing. That cost them another star.

Castlevania Chronicles is basically a remake of the first Castlevania, with remixed music and slightly updated graphics and gameplay. It was clearly intended to be for long time fans of the series, so younger game players may be confused by the lack of graphical quality.

Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect.  [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision].  Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans.  Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained.  Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada).  To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').\n\nInstead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts.  It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie.  Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice.  The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil.  They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied.  There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture.  Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen.  Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film.  The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone.  Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.\n\nThe differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a \"true story\" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims.  Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: \"The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs.\" and, \"I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'\"", "maybe you'll get another red bike this year -lrb- laughing -rrb-", "But, not too big a deal.

When his infrequently used, but essential Stanley 33-425 Powerlock 25-Foot by 1-Inch Measuring Tape that was just over a year old snapped at the six-inch mark, he wanted another one.\n\nThis is a heavy, solid feeling measuring tape.  The stand-out begins to bow slightly at 5  feet, but the bowing is not significant.  As stated in the product description, it does hold the stand-out fairly well up to 7-feet, but the stand-out is not straight.  The tape itself is 1 wide, not 1  as stated in the product description.  The hook is  and does keep the tape securely attached to the edge of the item you are measuring.  The metal case is 3 long.  The brake locks the tape in place; it must be pushed down toward the bottom of the case rather than being a push-button like those on Tekton measuring tapes.  Markings are clear and easy to read.  The belt clip is a useful feature for those who are on job sites and need to have their tape measure handy.\n\nI like that the Stanley 33-425 Powerlock 25-Foot by 1-Inch Measuring Tape is made in the USA - or at least it says on the product that it is.

The film is well acted by the entire cast, especially Hopkins as former president Adams and Freeman as an abolitionist businessman. These 2 actors are always good and Amistad is no exception.\nWhere the film falters is when Spielberg takes \"dramatic license\". Putting it simply, when he lies. The real story should have been enough for a great movie so the truth shouldn't have to be stretched to overdramatize events. The slavetraders were lousy human beings without a doubt but they didn't dump half the slaves in the ocean. Adams never met any of the Africans he defended so well and their presence in a courtroom is not believable. The speeches made in the film do not reflect 1839-40 attitudes, they reflect current ones.

The earlier version is grittier, perhaps not as smoothly played or expertly sung, but altogether more primal and exciting.

That game changed my life... in the gaming sense.  It was everything I ever thought a computer game should be: turn-based strategy with multiple avenues to test my ego and self-promoted genius.  Above all features of Civ3, however, my most favorite was the customization of the game through the map editor and the wonderful online resources of the Civ community.  (I've downloaded more Civ3 files than MP3s.)  This allowed me to express my self-proclaimed genius with new rules, technologies, and units (and all the accompanying chronologies and requisites) at my discretion.  Nothing could get any better, I had thought.\n\nWhen Civ4 was being talked about, however, I couldn't imagine on what grounds they could improve - except perhaps making the game even more customizable and thorough.  Well, you've already read about the differing features of the game: less micro-management, more diplomatic and trade features, new technology trees, enhancing popular mechanics found in previous Civ titles, and of course, going 3D with it all.\n\nWhen playing Civilization IV, you sense an overwhelming POTENTIAL to be a really great game.  In my mind, that potential has not been fulfilled, and I hereby advise you to purchase Civ3 Complete instead and forego Civ4 if you haven't chosen so already.  If you have already purchased Civ4, let's send a message to Firaxis Games that they need to do better - let's stop purchasing Civ products until they are actually without so many bugs, that aren't rushed to be released for the holidays, and that don't insult our intelligence by requiring expensive \"expansion packs\" which merely add content that should already have been included in the original release.\n\nHere is a list of comparative reasons to only own Civ3 and not Civ4 and boycott future Civ titles until something changes for the better:\n\n1.  There is no map editor in Civ4.  Instead, they included a \"World Builder\" which is so awkward and strange.  It is not like Civ3's map editor where you can set starting positions, resources, civilizations, and terrain BEFORE you play the map.  The \"World Builder\" of Civ4 only allows you to alter scenarios from the installation or randomly generated maps.  You cannot create maps from scratch - you can only change what has already been created within predefined parameters.\n\n2.  Who needs 3D graphics for a turn-based strategy game?  Civ4 is not fully 3D; it merely allows a tilting view from ground level to overhead.  That can be cool, but consider the offset: it is unnecessary for this genre, it diverts computer resources from other cool and more thorough features, and it makes the game extremely difficult to modify.  For Civ3, there are well over 1,000 things you can either download or make yourself and put right into the game.  You don't have to know XML or Python programming languages as you would in Civ4.  Civ4 requires advanced education (like a graphics design or computer science degree) to simply alter things like governments, units, buildings, and game rules.  Waiting for others to design them (like the amateur online community or the professional expansion packs) isn't so fun anymore.\n\n3.  Expanding content for more money?  This was a problem with Civ3, as well - its first expansion pack was a total waste of money because everything was later put on the second expansion pack.  People bought the first expansion pack because they loved Civ3 so much and didn't know it was a waste.  (Many video game makers are taking advantage of gamers in this way, not just the Civilization makers.)  My point here is to fight back.  We already know what they are going to pull: Civ4 has an expansion pack out there titled Warlords.  It basically includes elements intentionally left out so as to somehow formulate a \"new\" product.  In the base version of Civ4, you have the Great People: artists, scientists, merchants, and prophets.  Hmmm... now we get the warlords, eh?  Oh, and a few other civilizations and buildings left out from before.  Nice try...  Boycott this type of marketing out of sheer principle.  Play Civ3 Complete until Civ5 comes out if you have to.  Maybe Civ will be less of a cheap shot then.\n\n4.  The last reason why you should be content with Civilization III and completely forget that Civilization IV was ever made is the most simple.  Purchasing Civ3 Complete right now (1) will cost you less than half of Civ4; (2) is fully expanded while Civ4 is still looking to make more money off of us; and (3) Civ3 has the very same level of addictive game play as any other Civilization title.  If you have already dropped the cash for Civ4, simply do not support Civ4 any longer.  In fact, uninstall it and put it in your drawer as a sad chapter of shameless marketing.  Yes, Civ4 is fun, but it is does not live up to its potential in most ways.  Playing Civ3 will take up your time quite nicely until they release a REAL title that doesn't take advantage of us so blatantly.\n\nTo conclude, my overall point to stick with Civ3 and forego Civ4 is this: without an easy, efficient, and overwhelmingly powerful customizing interface (like an awesome map editor that allows FULL customization), we are simply asking for \"re-tread\" products.  The fact that Firaxis did not include a kick-butt map editor proves in my mind that they expect us to wait for their \"expansions\" to come out and spend at least $150 each before they move onto Civ5.  Hold out with Civ3 Complete and wait until Civ4 goes away.", "It was ok until a certain version of Mac, but wasn't support past a certain version. Not sure which, but I think v10.8 wasn't support by this version of Antivirus", "This was a quick, okay read. The writing was strong and the I really liked the intro. I liked Kendra, the young antiquities store assistant we met in the prologue. I even liked Ryan, the man we are introduced to in the epilogue. The two are supposed to be representative of Kendrick and Roane, two lovers from the 1800s who were torn apart by war and the mistaken reporting of Roane's death.\n\nI was not too fond of Kendrick or Roane. When Roane comes home to find that Kendrick has moved on in the face of his 'death', he is furious. He seeks to humiliate and bend her to his will to....what? I'm still not sure. It seemed as though he wanted her back, but he wanted her to squirm a bit as well. Fair enough. But the way he goes about it is a bit cruel for my taste and his 'foreceful seduction' of her was over the top and a turn off. When he finds she is a virgin, THEN he becomes contrite for being so cruel...for me it was too little too late to redeem him and honestly his complete 180 did not resonate with me. I still didn't care for him. Kendrick was a pushover and a flat character. At least Roane had some dimension.\n\nThe reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of a lower ranking is because I found the way the author wove and past and present together to be very clever. Also, the writing is very strong. But for me, this story could have been a bit stronger. I appreciated the attempt at making Roane a sympathetic character because of his bloody background in war.

This video is still great, but it leaves me longing for the deleted sequences that I know are supposed to be there.\n[Note:  The \"Rhythm Nation Compilation\" DVD has none of the deleterious aspects mentioned above]\nThumbs-Down #5:  The \"Whoops Now\" video is not enjoyable to me at all.

Katie locks the animal in a cage but is more than slightly disturbed when she goes to check on him and finds a naked man in his place. He cant explain what the heck has happened to him as he has amnesia and thats the least of her worries as her hands have somehow turned into paws. Luckily Out in the Open Paranormal Support (OOPS) is there to help.\n\nKatie escaped to the small town after she divorced her husband and is trying to set up a new business. Unfortunately the locals don't like her much and one guy even has a restraining order out against her for interfering with his animals. She keeps coming up with excuses not to get involved with Sparky such as he is too young date a woman in her 40s and later that he must be gay  she bases the latter on the fact he can remember Project Runaway even though he cant remember his name. She is terrified about changing species until the visible signs of ageing disappear from her body.\n\nSparky/Becks/Shaw is fairly charismatic given he woke up naked with no memory in a strange location. He might not know his name but he has a British accent, is fairly articulate, humorous and makes no attempt to hide his attraction to Katie. Apart from knowing when things feel right, Shaw is a fairly blank canvas and most of his time before he recovers his memory is spent doing activities that allow Katie to ogle him.\n\nCassidy puts a significant effort into snarky one liners which some times fall flat. I can handle Nina in small doses but her foul mouth comments were often over the top. She is so obnoxious that she dominated every scene she was in which unfortunately meant the romance between Katie and Sparky often took a back seat. The other members of OOPS are fairly ineffectual apart from a scene where they convince Katie and her assistants that they really are supernatural creatures. Their voices aren't that distinct and I really needed to concentrate to keep track of who was talking when.\n\nThere is a secondary mystery revolving around Daniel Green, the owner of the exotic animal place down the road. He accused OOPS members of beating him but they flatly deny it. Given the fact that Shaw was found in cougar form on the guys property, OOPS and Katie hope that Green has some answers, especially as Shaws shifts are so painful they border on deadly.\n\nI enjoyed some aspects of the novel such as when Katie discovered she could communicate with animals but I think I needed to be in a different mood to fully enjoy the style of humour that Cassidy employed.

Her first album was one of the longest-staying Top 200 album hits in Billboard history, but this CD, though a pace-setter initially, failed to make it as big as 'Forever your Girl' did. Upon repeat listens, it becomes clear why.\nLets first start with the singles. There are two US No. 1 hit singles here. The first track 'The Promise of a new day' was a No. 1 hit, and is perhaps the most danceable song on the entire LP. Remember the video with its' emphasis on waterfalls, fields of green, and a near-nude Paula going through the paces? The proceeds from this single went to the 'Save the Rainforest' campaign, but thats another story.\n'Rockhouse' sounds more like something from Paula's 'Head Over Heels' album, and one that suggests Paula's lack of musical common sense. Tracks such as these were what closed her career, and 'Spellbound' suffers from quite a few of these, the most notable being 'Will you marry me?' - quite obviously the worst Paula Abdul track ever.\nCritics and fans remember this CD because of 'Rush Rush', a tender ballad that did its time at No. 1 on the US Charts, holding its' own at a time when Michael Jackson's 'Black or White' fought for No. 1 too. The song, with its violin crescendo has made its' mark as an alltime Hallmark classic, and has found its way onto obscure love-song compilations, thus eroding its' novelty and listenability (to me, at least!). The video featured Keanu Reeves, by the way, as Paula's boyfriend. A bit of useless trivia for you!\nAnother Top 10 hit here is 'Blowing Kisses in the wind' (the video had Paula as a ballet dancer) which is a nice enough song, but it comes so late through the album that by this time its difficult to begin caring.\nTurkeys? Well, this album has its' share of those! First up is 'Will you marry me?' which the record company released as a single (it flopped). Then theres the totally forgettable dance track called 'Vibeology', which Paula performed at the 1992 MTV Video music Awards. By that time, failure and depression had taken its' toll and she had gained weight and sang and danced off-key. This performance signalled the end of her career almost immediately, which is why its hard to listen to this track without feeling nostalgic, in a sad sense.\n'Alright Tonight' is one of those tracks that act as a filler. The Import edition of this CD had 'Goodnight, My love' as an extra track, which was actually one of the album's finest tracks, so its a shame that it doesnt feature on the US edition. Oh well.\nAt the end of it, its evident why Paula failed the way she did. This CD has its moments, and is a fine remnant of the 80's but it is also stark clear that fluff like this will sink and not stand the test of time. Paula's next CD 'Head over Heels' proved this. A better bet would be 'Greatest Hits' as all the better songs from this album are on it.", "It is great for turning veggies into a puree, but not great for chopping.

First, the lower rated reviews of this product all mention the difficulty in cleaning it.  I concur. Cleaning the cake (as in \"let them eat cake\" meaning the black stuff caked on the inside of the oven) that accumulates between the ridges of the griddle surface is not easy. It takes a lot of work. None of my other Le Creuset pans (12\" pan and 9\" pan) have this problem. It is caused by the upraised griddle ridges. Maybe it is a problem for all griddles. But there is another problem. The design of the handle creates a concave two inch long groove at the end of the handle where it connects to the griddle. Grease and juice splatters that land in this depression can not adequately be cleaned off with a scrubbing pad because of the depression. You need a toothbrush. This depression does not occur on my other Le Crueset pans. Finally, I wish I had purchased the \"Signature\" edition. The Signature edition has those loop style handles opposite the main handle that make pouring from the pan and lifting the pan so much easier. My other pans are signature editions.

I have given him dehydrated liver and he will eat it if it is not too dry, however, I don't like the process of dehydrating liver as it smells bad and is messy to handle.

Works fine so far", "Oh boy! You guys, I FINALLY finished A Feast for Crows. I started this book in June or July of 2013 and finished it January 21, 2014. I would read one chapter in A Feast for Crows and then read something else shorter for fun. And thats how I made progress. Ive been trying to stay ahead of the show. I know that season 4 is going to be a mix from books 3, 4, & 5 because Season 3 didn't end where book 3 (A Strom of Swords) ended. Theres more to come there. But I also know that Season 4 will include some stuff from book 5 (A Dance with Dragons) which I plan to start ASAP.\n\nAll of that being said, I would have finished A Feast for Crows sooner but this was a SLOW book for me. All of the books in this series have started off slowly and built until they ended with some pretty major events. And while the last 20% of this book definitely had bigger things happening, the cliffhangers weren't as big as the ones in books past. The speed at which I can get through a book always plays into my overall experience of the book, but a slow book thats 300 pages long is completely different from a slow book thats over 1000 pages long. I was more than 600 pages inprobably more like 700 pagesbefore events started picking up pace. For the earlier parts of the book, I was wondering how most of the events even played into what happened in the previous books. That wasn't exactly the right question. The better question would have been how those events played into the ending of this book. Due to the length and pacing of these books, I definitely expect that this series is not for the average reader, but A Feast for Crows even more so. At one point I told my SNL, Holly @ Words Fueled by Love, that if some big things didn't happen in the last half of the book then I was going to tell her to skip it and I would just tell her what happens. Im not sure what I would recommend for her at this point. (She's reading it anyway just in case you're wondering.)\n\nNow to talk about the story itself.\n\nUnlike the previous books in the series, A Feast for Crows focuses on a smaller section of main characters. George R R Martin puts a note at the end of the book that he didn't forget about the other characters. He was writing this book and realized it was too big to publish without breaking it in half and instead of giving ALL of the characters half their story he decided to split the characters and give all the story. So A Dance with Dragons will focus on the characters that weren't focused on in A Feast for Crows. The main narrators of A Feast for Crows were Jamie, Cersie, Brienne, Arya, Sansa, and Sam with a few chapters here and there narrated by a random additional character.\n\nI did highlight a good bit in A Feast for Crows. I don't think Ive ever highlighted in any of the previous books in this series. These highlights were focused around things I thought might offer some foreshadowing. But truly it is so hard to tell with George R R Martin if hes even foreshadowing at all. Sometimes when reading this series, I find myself wondering if there was a point to what Ive been reading at all when all of a sudden a big surprise comes in and one of our characters gets killed off. Most books I consider masterpieces are the ones where every piece of information is important and fits into the overall story in just the right way. But with George R R Martin, I often wonder how much of any of it has a point and if that in and of itself isn't the brilliance of this series.\n\nA Feast for Crows is definitely different from the previous books in this series. And while I won't say that I didn't like it, I can see how it would be my (and many others) least favorite of the series. I do look forward to seeing how everything continues to play out, and I look forward to getting back to the other characters that Ive missed. I know I haven't really given you any information involving the storyline at this point or even discussing the character growth, but I just feel like both of these things are such important aspects of the story that I can't spoil anything for you.\n\nA Feast for Crows gets 3.5 Stars from me.

However I know MacLean is a good writer so I wanted to give her new series a shot. Apparently the heroine of this book was jilted in the previous series but you do not have to be familiar with those books to read this one.\n\nAnd this one started very promisingly. Male lead Michael Bourne lost his entire fortune and land, everything that wasn't entailed, on a bad hand of cards to his mentor and protector, the father of his best friend. After losing everything, he is ostracized from society and driven solely by his need for revenge. He manages to rebuild and even outpace his fortune in only nine years by owning a gaming club and the final piece of the puzzle is Falconwell, which has been attached to Lady Penelope Marbury's dowry.\n\nPenelope is a 28-year-old spinster who was jilted years earlier as her fiance sought a love match and now secretly hopes for the same herself; she wants more. I liked Penelope immediately, which made it all the harder to endure the male lead's, who is supposed to be a HERO, treatment of her. He is absolutely horrid to her. He abducts her with the cold intention of regaining his land; he could have played it much better due to their childhood friendship. He did not have to be a monster; he easily could have wooed and won her. But he chose the easy route, not the right route. And he doesn't stop there. He emotionally distances her while boring me with how much he wanted her body. There are glimpses of a decent person but only that. I cannot believe I kept reading, just to find his redemption.\n\nLuckily that redemption was handled well and is responsible for the high rating here. I never got over my first impression of Michael especially because I loved Penelope so much and wanted more for her.  She wanted and deserved to be passionately loved but Michael just kept breaking her heart into little pieces and proving his unworthiness. I prefer a different kind of man in my romance novel.\n\nI guess I'm kind of getting the impression that MacLean and I just don't click.

I've installed hitches before especially on Jeeps but this one was the most difficult. But once I figured this out I was able to install it. It looks and works great. Not sure if all are like this or mine was a fluke, but the box was not banged up at all when delivered.

Personally, I felt Friedmen's description of globalization was for the most part on target.  With the internet, investments in various markets is very much like a big herd of cows coming in a rushing wealth into various countries, and then stampeding its way out.  The world is moving faster and faster.  It is homogenizing at a very rapid pace.  Although overhyped the internet had a huge effect on productivity across the world, braking down walls, and giving voice to those who have none.  However, Friedmen's opinions on globalization are just are too idealistic.  Some of the more negative reviews seem to critizise the books  optimistic tone and even admit that they couldn't even finish the book.  The first part of the book is extremely that way however, after chapter 13 the book does try to address globalization's negative points.\n\nDespite that, like any pleasing ideology the book contradicts itself many times.  One should not put walls up to block out globalization, but it should have this idealistic filter that would allow people to protect their culture and embrace the fruits of globalization. Another example would be free markets are great and communism is bad, but every country should put some idealistic \"social safety net\" up that will protect people but at the same time give people incentive to work.  All of these things are easy to say, hard to implement.  Friedman is a bright man, and has thought though many of these globalizations issues throughly.  Although not a perfect book, was a decent attempt to describe globalization. However, Friedman describes many things in the world like milk,  things simply have a short shelf life.  This pre 9/11, pre enron, pre bush, pre tech bubble burst book simply has too many expired ideas. If you want a reasonably good description how globaliation was perceived in the 90's then read this book.  Parts of the Lexus and the olive tree still apply to this world however if you want a more up to date understanding of the world, read his new book \"Longitudes and Attitudes : The World in the Age of Terrorism.\"", "\"Think Of Laura\" is another mellower than mellow track from Christopher Cross.

For its' time the graphics were great and the story was definetly something original no other game developer team had tried before. If you were to ask which I found more scary..being attacked by flesh eating mutants or receiving a genuine letter from a deceased loved one written AFTER they had died I'd be inclined to say the later.\n\nRegardless that is the Dilehma James is faced with. His dead wife has lured him back to Silent-hill and you know THAT is not going to be a happy walk in the park.\n\nFirst of all let me say I think this game really made people \"re-think\" the survival horror genre. It tried being witty, intelligent, and chalked with macabre symbolism as opposed to zombie arms that broke through windows. Even the side characters were more than simply devices to move the plot along. Eddie and Angela have their own interesting inner demons too and Maria looks just like James's deceased wife though her personality is drastically different. If that is not enough to sell you on this premise I could simply say \"Oh yeah this game introduces Pyramid-Head\". That alone will have people lining up in droves.\n\nNow putting everything good about the game aside I'm going to be brave and talk about why I think while it deserves \"praise\" it still is not all that and a side order of extra big fries. Yes, I know this is the game the elite Silent Snoots put on a pedestal. The one game no other SH can compare to. The Holy Grail of team silent. Is it that earth shattering?  For me anyway it was not.\n\nAs with the other games there is a suspenseful build up. First it is sounds. Then it is fleeting shadows. Finally it is full blown creatures. The only problem is often there are not enough monsters and instead you are forced to aimlessly wander around trying to collect keys or pieces of an obscure puzzle. Now I admit sometimes its' fun to run around an enviorment without fear of dying to see those little details. However in a survival horror game you should never begin lulling into a calm sense of security and that's the biggest flaw of the game. In most areas I felt \"safe\" and that the monsters were easy to manuever around. Every once in awhile an eager lurching Pyramid-Head made my heart race a bit but besides for the beloved apron adorned big guy no other creatures instilled in me any amount of dread.\n\nThe true disturbing factor comes from interacting with Eddie and Angela. I will not divulge why they are so psychologically unstable but talking with them alone requires a few steel nerves. These are normal people that \"snapped\" and you get the feeling you are a participant in their  horrorifying delusions. Things get stranger when you meet Maria, the sultry Dopple-ganger of Mary who embodies all Jame's sexual fantasies given flesh. Is she Jame's wife's ghost? Sadly Silent Hill never makes an explaination that easy so you have to keep playing to find out.\n\nAs the game slowly drags on it picks up when we find out James has his own dark secret. When you finally get that revelation everything comes together and you know why Silent Hill's foggy streets beckoned to him.\n\nNow there is one thing I like to make clear to the fans. Pyramid Head pursued James because James subconciously wanted to be punished for his past misdeeds however  a few references from the other games prove the executioner has been apart of the town history for a long time. PH was not manifested from James, he was merely drawn to James. This is why it is OK PH was in the movie and ok he is in SH V.\n\nExamples\n\n1. In origins the gillespie house had a picture of PH. Origins took place way before Jame's arrival.\n\n2. The Room talked about \"the red devil\" and Jimmy stone. This story ties into PH if you read it carefully.\n\n3. Another document in Origins talked about \"the executioner\" as well.\n\n4. In SH 3 there is a picture of one of Alessa's past goddess incarnations with PH in the background amongst a few other people. You can view it in the cathedral.\n\nI just wanted to clear that up because there is a HUGE DEBATE raging PH should be confined to only this game which I find to be a waste of breath.\n\nAs you can expect the music in this game is haunting and very befitting of Jame's sad tale and descent into madness to find his redemption. If there is one thing SH 2 gets right it is estabalishing a powerful thought provoking mood.\n\nCombat is what you expect from SH. You are not going to be able to fight like a marine. A plank with nails in it is your first weapon. That should tell you something right there. Eventually you get a few guns and a few other melee weapons besides your buddy \"Plank-zorz\".  Aside from stomping on monsters when they're down you are not a golden glove brawling champion. Perhaps it is for this reason it is good why most of the monsters are so gosh darn pathetic. Besides for the acid spewing of the patient monsters and the sheer size of the abstract daddies nothing made me feel over-whelmed that often.\n\nSo in the end I'll say this game is great for atmosphere and a brilliant story. If you can stomach a horror game with more emphasis placed on wandering around, solving puzles, and talking to crazy lunatics to glean disturbing revelations you can likely over look the fact the combat engine is uninspired and the monsters are more scarce than the items in your inventory.", "I wanted to give this book a raving, positive review in light of the previous excellent books in the series, but in all honesty, I just can't do it.\n\nI fear that Martin has fallen in line with the Jordan debacle, The Wheel of Time, although I'm reluctant to make that comparison (not too reluctant, because I just did it).

Those are the opening words of the quasi-apology issued by  movie impresario Harvey Weinstein  after The New York Times reported that  he  had sexually preyed on women for the past 30 years.\nAccording to the Times  Weinstein  one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful men  invited the actress Ashley Judd to a meeting in  his  hotel room then asked if she\u2019d watch  him  shower.  He  promised another young woman that  he \u2019d help her career in exchange for sex.  He  asked a female assistant to give  him  a massage while  he  was naked. There were others.\n Weinstein  has denounced the Times report and is threatening to sue  but  he  also issued a mea culpa for unspecified wrongs  he  has done and pain  he  has caused  with the suggestion that  his  problem is rooted in the world that shaped  him .\n\u201cThat was the culture then \u201d  he  said in  his  statement.\n Weinstein  was born in 1952  the year before the recently departed Hugh Hefner invented Playboy magazine.  He  grew up in an era when men yukked it up over Playboy playmates  which corresponded to the moment that women  newly liberated by the birth control pill  were finding their way in record numbers into college  grad school and jobs once reserved for men.\nHow much mercy does  Weinstein  deserve because  he  came into power when men were less likely to be outed for using it in abusive  sexual ways?\n His  adviser in this scandal  the attorney Lisa Bloom  who ordinarily defends women in sexual harassment cases  has called him \u201can old dinosaur learning new ways.\u201d\n We \u2019re all products of  our  time.  Weinstein  came into adulthood in an age that made it easier for men to kids themselves that harassment was OK. But deep down  I\u2019m guessing   he  always knew it was wrong.

My big complaint is that the selection of music and other sounds that the piano makes aren't very good.  On one setting, it plays several children's songs (instrumental only) - the sound quality is OK, but nothing special...certainly not as good as the sound on the Imaginarium mobiles.  On another setting, it says an animal name when a key is kicked (\"dog\") and provides the sound of the animal (again, the sound quality of the animal sounds is pretty poor in my opinion).  Another kick and a number is said, then a few bars of a song.  Lights flash.  Really, nothing too exciting.  The songs are the same on every setting; the main difference is how much of each song is played and how many are played in a row.  I find the one-word animal and number identification just plain boring.

Nintendo has been making games for over thirty years now, and they have a legacy second to none.  As such, any product they produce must be of the highest quality, if only to live up to the hype.\n\nThe wii is a mixed bag, and only partially lives up to the positive press.\n\nConstruction wise the machine is fantastic.  I've dropped mine, knocked it over, kicked it, gotten it wet and it still works like the day I got it.  The controllers are of a similar build quality; I have abused them in a similar manner, even having a friend mistakenly throw one against the wall, and they are fine.\n\nBeyond the construction, the Wii can be great.  Can being the optimal word.  The system definitely appeals, but to a different market then games of the last generation marketed to.  By this I mean that if you are a \"hardcore\" gamer, who revels in endless hours on the latest and greatest first person shooter (FPS), this isn't really for you.  Why do I say this?  Simple.  The games on the Wii aren't of this nature.\n\nMost/all of the games are targeted at a much more casual group of gamers.  For Nintendo this is probably a great move, as this \"casual\" market is larger then the \"hardcore\" market, but for many of us diehard fans might consider this a bit of a let down, and if you are reading this you probably take your games seriously enough that you will want something more.  In the next few sections I'll break the Wii down a bit, so you understand exactly what you are getting if you buy it.\n\nWhen you buy a Wii you get the wii itself, a Wiimote (wireless controller) and a copy of Wii Sports.  Technically there are two things that make the Wii different then the other consoles of the same generation.  First, and most importantly, it uses a non-traditional control mechanism called \"Wii Motion.\"  This is a combination of infared sensors and accelerometers which allow you to \"interact\" with your games naturally.  An example is the Baseball game in Wii sports, which allows you to swing your bat by swinging the Wiimote in a swing-like motion, and causes your avatar on screen to swing his bat in the same manner.  This \"Wii Motion\" functionality is not used in every game, but it plays prominent in many; Wii specific games will doubtlessly involve some use of these mechanics, be it pointing at the screen as if you had a mouse, or shaking the Wiimote to spin Mario in a circle.  When not using such functionality the Wii controller can be used like a normal, albeit uncomfortable, controller by holding it sideways and using the traditional control pad grafted to one end.  Other games involve a secondary attachment to the Wiimote called the \"nunchuck\" which connects to the Wiimote by way of a small cord.  This also has some \"Wiimotion\" capabilities, but mostly is there for the extra buttons and a small thumb joystick.  I'd say that almost all the games I've played on the Wii, beyond the Wii Sports/Fit have involved this Nunchuck to a large extent, and if you are going to be playing a lot of games on your\n\nWii you will have to buy one (does not come with the Wii).\n\nMy commentary on the Wii Motion and control scheme is this.  It isn't great.  It's a gimick.  The controllers just don't allow fine enough control for most games, and they aren't really easy to use either.  Games involving Wii Motion features are mostly spent trying to figure out exactly what motion the Wii wants and then doing your best to repeat it.  This can be fun, but it isn't intuitive, and for most games it is just a pain in a neck.  Doubtlessly this is the reason many games on the Wii, including the latest Mario installation (Mario Galaxy), have almost no Wii Motion elements, and simply use the normal controller features of the Wiimote and nunchuck.  These \"normal\" features are fine.  The Wiimote-nunchuck combination is suprisingly comfortable in your hands, and control is excellent.  However, by the time you have bought both items you have basically paid $60 for one controller.  So, if you wanted the full 4 controllers you have paid: $200 for the full set.  This is compared to the $150 for 3 PS3 (or Xbox 360) controllers.  The Wii's controllers also lack a \"charge while you play\" feature.  This causes you to buy chargable batteries, or to buy lots of replacements, and the controllers do eat batteries.  Overall, I'd give the Wii's controls a mediocre rating at best.  I'd have much rather had a traditional wireless controller with good battery life, and a \"charge while you play\" feature.\n\nNow, to give a holistic overview, we must address the Wii's software.  The Wii itself has great software.  The interface is intuitive and unobtrusive.  Updates happen very seemlessly and painlessly through the wifi, and configuration and setup is a breeze.  No one should ever complain about the Wii's interface, especially compared to the obnoxious layered menu system of the xbox 360, or the large tree of options presented by the ps3.  However, the system's interface isn't what usually interests users, so much as the games themselves.\n\nThe Wii's games...  Before I continue I want to make a small point about the Wii.  It is a hardware concern that I didn't mention above, but it really effects the games produced.  This concern is the fact that Wii is not much of a performance increase over the gamecube.  The result are graphics that are not as visually stunning and those found on the PS3 or Xbox 360.  Also of note is that the Wii does not provide true HD video, but merely some upscaled 480p.  These combined attributes are definitely a major factor in the sad truth about Wii games, which is that they are not cutting edge installments with the best graphics and the hottest gameplay.  Every game I've played for Wii has been one of a few\n\ncategories.  1) Gimicky use of the Wii Motion.  2) A Nintendo produced rehashing of one of their key franchises (Mario, Zelda).  3) A port from another console.\n\nI'll expand on this categories with examples:\n1) examples: Wii Sports, Wii Fit, Wii Sports Resort\n  These consist of a bunch of mini games centered around use of the Wii Motion Capabilities.  Fun, but mostly just a gimicky display of a neat technology.  These are the most fun to play with others.  So I'd consider them a \"party\" game.\n2) examples: Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart Wii, Zelda Twilight Princess\n  Great games, worthly sucessors to the franchises, and the closest to targeting the \"hardcore\" market on the Wii.  Still, they are basically status quo for nintendo.  Don't expect anything magical with these.\n3) Port\n  Gamecube games updated and released, or virtual console games (emulated games from other systems --genesis, snes, nes, ect-- on the Wii)\n  This category is great, and a saving grace, in my opinion.  I've spent probably half my time on the Wii playing virtual console games, but they are costly, ($5-$15 a pop)  and not original content.\n\nThese categories pretty much describe ALL games I've seen for the Wii.  I'd summerize by saying that the Wii has little \"original\" content, and  does not a vast library of games.  Games on it are fun, but they are gimicky party games to play with your friends.  It is a sad sad truth, but I'd say that the Wii is basically a gimped system, stuck with its core contigency of status quo items (Zelda, Mario, Metroid) and with little to no third party development going on.\n\nI suggest the Wii for anyone who wants one of these few things: A bunch of Gimicky party games. More of Nintendo's staple fair, such as Mario. OR a never ending supply of old nintendo classics for download (costs money).\n\nDo NOT buy the Wii if you want a modern gaming experience with all the bells and whistles.\n\nI want to clarify before I end this review.  The Wii is a great system.  There is nothing better, in my mind, the bashing each other in a rousing game of Mario Kart or Smash Brothers.  The virtual console is also a great feature, and has created many nostalgia filled hours for me.  That said, be aware that in many ways it is technologically inferior to its siblings AND it isn't really as cheap as it claims to be, due to the cost of all the necessary accessories.\n\nIf you don't care about having the latest and greatest and want something you can sit down with for a few minutes here and there (and have a great time with) the Wii is the system for you.\n\nFinal Word: I own all three systems.  I would buy my Wii again.", "A middle-aged man, on hearing recently that Sammy Davis Jr. was near death, remarked, ''I can't imagine a world without Sammy Davis in it.''", "Did not return however it was bent and I had to bend it back into shape", "MIXED review:My husband loved these; for me, however, only one of the many snacks was tasty.", "the espresso is very good, but does tend to leak water from the joint where the top and bottom get screwed on, despite a rubber gasket.

FURY revolves around a main hero, Merrick, who is an alpha werewolf, and Nikki, who happens to be a werecougar that the pack elders want to make Queen.  Hot sex ensues, followed by the inevitable HEA filled with more hot sex.\n\nAs I said, I did enjoy the concept of the story, and I probably would have moved that to REALLY liked if not for two things.  One, although I recognize the \"I-just-met-you-but-want-to-sex-you-up-now\" plot device, especially in stories involving shapeshifters who seem to \"recognize\" their mates upon meeting, just a tad more introduction before the horizontal tango would have been nice.  And secondly, holy crow, this story badly needed an editor before it went up!  I know Ms. Bast has published a bunch of stories through large-name publishers, but due to the lack of editing, I'm guessing this wasn't one of them.\n\nSo overall, a great concept - I'd definitely be interested in reading a full-length novel or novella starring the OtherKin.

I have also seen Solaris which is similarly a good movie.\n\nBut I just can't get myself to finish watching Nostalghia.  Tarkovsky specializes in Russian-style films which are long and slow-paced by Western standards and the two mentioned above are worth the effort.  But Nostalghia goes on and on and never seems to get anywhere.  The closest thing to a plot involves an expatriate Russian poet in Italy who is traveling with his Italian interpreter.  She is attractive but he has no romantic interest in her and they stay in separate rooms.  The whole idea is apparently that he is more interested in art and unusual experiences than her.  They encounter various scenes such as fields, churches, and largely deserted villages which are really the basis of the movie.\n\nThey eventually reach a rundown isolated village where the poet encounters a man who would be considered mentally disturbed today but then just someone odd in the village.  This man believes he can save the world by walking through some puddle and the poet is fascinated by this.  This whole episode probably takes about an hour; I could only fast forward through it.\n\nThe main object of the movie is apparently to portray different forms of art such as classical music and anything unusual such as the village man.  There are two many long takes which seem to mean nothing except contemplating some mundane scene.  These include things like fog, puddles of water, and church interiors.  Just about everything in this movie is implied so just about everything has to be inferred.  The problem here is that Tarkovsky's frame of reference is alien to most people.\n\nIf you can make it through this movie there may be something more memorable than the endurance required to finish it.", "I had one of these models and after four years the shutoff valve on top just broke.

Therefore, I would never \"hard use\" this knife. The clip point blade is ideal for thrusting soft materials but the very tip of mine has already broken off somehow which I am going to blame on the steel and thin tip thickness because I really haven't abused this knife. Maybe it was a bad batch of steel or maybe it was poor treatment of it by SOG. The serrations are decent for cutting rope and chord and there is enough belly that there is still a lot of plain edge to work with. The finish also comes of pretty easily which is bad because this steel rusts if not cared for (ie. used in a survival scenario). The handle is well textured on the sides and shaped for medium to large sized hands. The recess for your thumb on the spine is awkward because of the flared guard and really needs to be jimped to work well in my opinion. The steel also looses its edge pretty quickly so I wouldn't use it for hunting and skinning but it is easy to sharpen.

That there are also moments that had me gritting my teeth, and so many \"buts\", is what makes this review a tough one.\n\nThe graphics, for example, are by and large quite lovely, very atmospheric... But.  Half-Life 2, the game engine's parent, made better use of them, from both a hardware and a software perspective.  Half-Life 2 ran well on my system with 512 MB of RAM; Vampire stuttered somewhat(when I upgraded to 2 GB, it smoothed out nicely.)  Half-Life 2 also just _looks_ better, and doesn't distract with clipping, strands of wavy hair passing through the sides of people's faces, and moments of rough texturing.\n\nThe game combines RPG and action elements, which is frequently fun and interesting, but...  It expects you to react too quickly for an RPG, and the way numbers are crunched will annoy action gamers.  Even with your \"natural\" stats maxed out in a particular set of combat-based stats, you can easily find yourself gunned down by a larger group, or by some of the more powerful bosses.  Some of the \"supernatural\" abilities may offset this; I can't say for certain, having only played through the game once.  What I do know is that my character was pretty combat-centric, and still only won certain battles because of bugs or defects in the AI- enemies unable to hit you from certain positions, or getting stuck on pieces of the scenery.\n\nThe game allows a fair amount of flexibility in how you approach problems... But some of the options are either so convoluted or so difficult as to be unworkable, while others are excessively easy.  Stealth in particular seems broken; I \"stealth killed\" any number of people who walked right into me, then turned around a few seconds later.\n\nOn the whole, the game feels poorly tested.  Some abilities are far, far more useful than others, and unless I'm missing something, a character without at least one area of solid combat focus is simply going to die.  You can't carry more than one of a type of gun, though selling all the duplicates one runs across on dead foes would have made it easier to raise money (which is ludicrously available at some times and completely sparse at others.)\n\nThen there's the end game, where... Well, without spoilers, let me just call it kind of unsatisfying.  Other endings may be available, but what I saw suggests they're merely variations on a theme, and that theme focuses more on some of the other characters you meet than on your own.  After some of the ridiculously hard battles I fought, I'd like to know how _my_ character ultimately fared, maybe a spot of congratulations.  Doesn't seem so much to ask, y'know?\n\nOh, one more word about those battles.  The final boss or bosses are so ridiculously over-powered that I felt no shame at all in using any exploit available.  One of them can repeatedly teleport and hit you from behind before you can react.  The only way to avoid this is very precise timing and repeating a pattern over and over again.  Said foe requires more than ten times as many hits to defeat as he does to defeat you.  This kind of fight really makes you go: \"Guys?  What were you _thinking_?\"  When _succeeding_ isn't even any fun...!\n\nDespite bugs and combat, I must give some significant praise:  The dialogue is terrific, both in the writing and in the performance.  I especially appreciated some of the humorous moments, much needed in the grim setting.  The atmosphere is great, from the haunted hotel you encounter early in the game to the lairs of twisted, unholy creatures.  The game generally feels _adult_, not in the sense in which the term is often used (where it could as easily be termed 'juvenile') but in a willingness to recognize shades of gray and handle uncomfortable topics without flinching.\n\nThough I would hardly call the game an unqualified success, I enjoyed it, and I mourn for Troika, the now-deceased company that created it.  Hardly anyone makes role-playing games combining character depth, plot depth and flexiblility to different player approaches the way they did.  If only they had done a little more testing... If only they had settled the combat system more firmly in the RPG or action arena... If only...\n\nP.S.  Looking over this review, it occured to me that some might take my comment about \"using any exploit available\" to mean using a third-party hacking program or cheat codes; I used neither to complete the game.  But if, say, a boss character got \"hung up\" on a corner, unable to move... I took no particular shame in whaling the tar out of them while they were unable to reciprocate.

Nevermind broke Nirvana into the mainstream and a certain kind of alternative music as well. Well I am not to preach what alternative music is however a lot of great acts that were around the time did not get any credit or sales even though their material was way better than this. So many great and original artist who still make excellent album recieved perhaps more attention for their works in the 1990's that they would have gotten before but indeed it seemed though this album seem to change face of rock n roll . Rock ( especially in the US) was about being angry, fast and depressing and many other bands that would perhaps make it big in other countries were not velcomed by American Listeners even though they are a lot more alternative then some of the acts that recieve the same stamp.\nHowever Nevermind has appeared in a lot of best of list around the years and many magazine rank it high as one of the greatest albums of all time. Is this album great. No. It is good but not great.\nThe problem lies in the songwriting. The fact was that Kurt only knew few chords and riffs and managed to write bunch of songs with them. Many of his songs sound the same and are pratically the same but with different lyrics and different tone.\nThe production is flawless however Butch vig who produced it did a very good job with about half of the tracks. Why do I say half well about 5 or 6 songs on this album are just noise. You can't hear what Kurt is singing about and they are very poorly played. The fact is that Butch probably found it very difficult to do something outstanding with these tracks and tried best as he could. The fact that he should have take notes from Steve Albini who recorded and kind of produced Nirvana's third album In Utero and just engineer and mix and skip making anything out of them except that.\nNevermind contains however some good such like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, Polly, On A Plain but the rest is either bad or does not live up to the same qualities as the other songs. These songs are not raw but a plane bore. Perhaps the other members of the band should have helped by writing the other material sole without Kurt's help.\nThe fact is that Nevermind seems like a half-finished album. When you skip these fillers you have 6 songs that are really good. I don't care what this album did for the music business we should look at albums for what they are. These are disc or Vinyl with music on them. If the music is not good the album isn't.\nTo this date many hail Nevermind as one of the rock's greatest albums. It is a good album but certainly not one of rock's greatest achievement in music history and certainly not one of Seattle's grunge best album. The fact is that Kurt Copain was not just a singer-songwriter but he was like Madonna and others a new face in music that everyone wanted a piece of and he was prortrait to be cool and something new however he was not even close of being one of the greatest songwriters of his era he was just lucky.\nAlso is that before his death this album had sold 5 million in the US. After his death it has sold 10 million copies in the US. Pearl Jam sold 11 million copies of their album Ten and nobody died from that band.\nOverall grade 6/10.", "Not very impressed with this mic.

I checked out a copy of \"2112\" from my local library and sat down to listen to something great. I would not say I was disappointed by the album but I guess I would say I was underwhelmed by it. This is not a bad album. The songs on here are pretty good with that progressive rock feel to it you may associate with the '70s. But for me it sounded kind of flat. Like the music needed more depth to it. Then I started reading some of the reviews here on Amazon for this album. One common complaint I kept reading was how disappointing the 5.1 surround sound to this recording was. After listening three times to this album before considering writing a review on it I have to agree with this main complaint by other reviewers. There is some good music on here that unfortunately I feel isn't given proper sound engineering to bring out the best in this album. And that is a shame.\n\nStill I for one would not not recommend this album to anyone. Give \"2112\" a listen. The songs on it are great even if the sound is seriously lacking in depth. If the sound quality was better here I would be giving \"2112\" four or maybe even five stars. As it is I will give it three stars just on the strength of the songs themselves.

Soulfly have definitely since moved on to create some very strong material, but if I set aside nostalgia and judge this album fairly on its own merits I cannot claim it is a very good record.\n\nThe album sets the tone for most Soufly albums to come; the material blends together world music influences and groove metal along with Nu Metal sections like Sepultura's 1996 album Roots, and similarly it was also produced by Ross Robinson, this time fresh from producing Limp Bizkit's 1997 debut album Three Dollar Bill, Yall$.\n\nLimp Bizkit's front man Fred Durst (and also DJ Lethal) makes a guest vocal appearance on the album on the track `Bleed,' but he isn't the only musician to perform on the album aside from the members of Soulfly. Chino Marino from the Deftones shows up on `First Commandment,' and Benji Webb from Skindred adds some of his distinctive flavour to `Prejudice.'\n\nEven the albums main single `Eye For An Eye,' features Burton C Bell and Dino Cazarez from Fear Factory, who's bassist Christian Olde Wolbers appears on yet another of the album's tracks later on. All that is before you even consider the non-famous contributors like tribal percussionist and Max's friends and relatives. The album is much more like a large project, some grand experiment like Probot or Roadrunner United than the debut album of a band who write songs together in a room.\n\nI did like the album for a time, but it has not aged very well. I find it difficult to listen to in one sitting and think it is more of an album for cherry picking a few of the best moments from than sitting down to and consuming whole. Don't get me wrong, even with all I've said there are some moments on the album that are very good, `Bumbklaat,' and `Fire,' are good songs.\n\nI also like the intro to `First Commandment,' even if it is a little too similar to Tool's `Disgustapated,' for comfort and finally `Eye For An Eye,' is good even if you do sometimes feel a little like it is an attempt to repeat the success of Roots Bloody Roots however knowing or unknowingly that may be on Max's part.\n\nOverall though, the music for me at least is a little to plain and uninteresting during the proper metal sections, and the tribal sections do not fit as well as on subsequent Soufly Records. This, coupled with the production and the aforementioned disjointed project feel makes this album Soulfly's weakest in my opinion. I wouldn't go as far as to say it is valueless and Soulfly fans should check it out and judge for themselves, but unfortunately this is not an album that I personally enjoy all that much.", "The game itself is not bad the graphics are slightly above average and the game play is kinda fun, very simular to kessen 2.

That being said, the game is still full of bugs. The story-killer for me is the major bug getting the fire chalice from that fallen paladin between the central region and the desert. Though I've enjoyed the game, and though the fire chalices are supposedly not necessary to finish it, I think this is a huge failure on the developer's part.\n\nMost of the other bugs everyone is complaining about I haven't encountered. No one has got stuck in walls, and no items have disappeared out of my inventory. However, one time I boot it up and it does this strobe like flashing, the next time my character moves at super speed, so fast it's almost a blur, or sometimes both.

It has a wide open world, plenty of action, and the combat system is not overly complicated. I just happen to like the simple quests. I'd prefer not to have to use a clue book constantly to play the game and this game is easy enough that I can just go out, kill a bunch of monsters, pick up some great loot and complete lots of quests.

Medium in spiciness but overall mediocre flavor", "Still struggling with the exit of Peter Criss, Ace Frehley's indifference, and waning interest from a fanbase that was starting to feel cheated by the band, KISS stepped into the studio in March of 1981 and began work on their most ambitious album up to that point:  Music From The Elder.\n\nUnder the guidance of producer Bob Ezrin, the band, along with new drummer Eric Carr, created an album that is generally hated and despised by the bulk of KISS' core fanbase.  There are a few of us out there, though, who either love or at least appreciate the album and what it stood for at that point in KISStory.\n\nBefore Elder, KISS was looked at as a mostly loud and hairy rock band with an explosive live show.  Then the group produced the four solo projects, Dynasty, and the ill-received Unmasked, and this left many fans wondering exactly where the group was headed.\n\nIf works like Dynasty and Unmasked estranged their fanbase, Music From The Elder put a boot through their foreheads.  It was unlike anything the band created before or since, and it has taken all of the thirty years of its existence to finally gain a bit of acceptance.\n\nThe album was a concept album, which was in stride with contemporary bands of the time such as The Alan Parsons Project, Pink Floyd, and Styx.  The sound, however, was completely alien to standard KISS fans.\n\nIn September of 1981, when fans hit the record stores to purchase KISS' latest album, what they received was an album that waded through ballads (with orchestral arrangements to boot), Paul Stanley singing in falsetto, and hints of Rush laced throughout the album.\n\nThe album opens with orchestral fanfare and then goes into Just A Boy, a tune with music and Paul Stanley vocals very reminiscent of the Christian rock band Petra during the Greg X. Volz years.  The next two tracks, Odyssey and Only You, ar slow tempo ballads, with Only You being just a tad bit heavier.\n\nThe album gets even heavier with the very Rush-sounding Under The Rose, which features Gene Simmons on vocals.\n\nIt isn't until the Ace Frehley co-written Dark Light where hints of the old KISS sound rise to the surface.  Frehley shines big on both his vocal and string performance on this tune.  It is, in my opinion, the best song on the entire album.\n\nA World Without Heroes, is next, and stands just behind Dark Light in quality in my opinion.  If you've ever listened to Gene Simmons' solo album, you can hear just how much of his solo sound is in this song.\n\nAfter the somewhat quiet interlude of A World Without Heroes, KISS kicks it up a notch with The Oath.  While I personally like this tune, it doesn't work as well as Dark Light in my opinion.  In fact, I prefer the song that follows it, Mr. Blackwell, and the instrumental Escape From The Island, much more.\n\nMr. Blackwell follows Dark Light as the most KISS sounding song on the album to me.  If the lyrics weren't about the villainous Blackwell and were instead about sex or scantily clad women, it would be the perfect sludgy Demon tune for an album like Hotter Than Hell.  Escape From the Island features some fine stringwork by Frehley, and excellent drum work from Eric Carr.\n\nThe concept album closes with the anthemic I.  It is the only song on the album that I find myself singing along with out loud.  It has a very Queen feel to it and the excellent chorus keeps me interested throughout the entire song.\n\nSo, is Music From The Elder a bad album?  Not at all.  In fact, when compared to other concept albums of that time, it holds up quite well.  When compared to the rest of KISS' catalogue, however, it fails to crack my personal top ten.  I appreciate what the band was attempting to do with this album, and actually quite enjoy Dark Light and A World Without Heroes, but I feel that at this point in the band's career, they were lost and searching for anything to spark interest in their music again.  Thankfully, the KISS ship would be righted somewhat by the band's next album, Creatures of the Night, which allowed Eric Carr to show people what type of drummer he really was and give Gene Simmons meatier tunes to sink his tongue into.\n\nI recommend Music From The Elder to non-KISS fans who enjoy concept albums like The Wall and Kilroy Was Here.  I also believe that any true KISS fans should own this album whether they enjoy it or not for the simple fact that it includes the last musical contributions from Ace Frehley until 1996's KISS Unplugged.", "Interferes with glass screen protector.

R. Martin fan (if not, start with \"A Game of Thrones\", which is absolutely excellent) and you've heard some of the controversy surrounding this book's release, you're wondering whether to keep going with the series or hold off, etc.\n\nFirst, I give credit where credit is due.  Martin is still a Class-A writer; that hasn't changed.  This is a riveting, emotionally taut book that, although quite a bit different in style from the previous books, still holds the reader's attention.  (Like how I presume to talk for all readers everywhere?)  Further, I think Martin's plan to cut what would have been an uber-huge Book 4 into Book 4 and Book 5 was a gutsy move--guts being something contemporary writers rarely display, especially when dollars and publishing houses get involved.\n\nStill, I have to admit that I wasn't completely blown away by this most recent edition to \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".  That's by no means an overall negative review, though.  As I said, the writing here is still very good; I think the story lines and plot actually progress quite well, despite what some critics have said.  I was particularly impressed with how Jaime and Brienne's respective characters developed.  And I suspect that once Book 5 comes out, Martin's logic behind dividing the story will be more clear.\n\nIn the end, I really only have a couple complaints to this book, one of them being the very un-Martin-like ending.  Don't worry; I won't spoil it if you haven't read the book yet.  I'll just say that it's a towering cliffhanger that might have been forgivable if Martin weren't so patently slow in releasing these books.  To make his EXTREMELY loyal, generally very intelligent and very grateful fans wait years in the real world just to find out what happens a couple seconds later in Westeros strikes me as a dirty trick.  I was also alarmed to hear that Martin was working on other projects, rather than concentrating on getting Book 5 out there.\n\nGranted, these are REAL books, not slush.  As a writer myself (not that I'm comparing myself to Martin, of course), I understand that writing a good book takes time.  Fans of the fantasy genre in general, though, are probably the most long-suffering readers out there.  We have to contend with hackneyed writers by the dozen, so when a true writer like Martin comes along and hooks us with a series like \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" which requires a true investment on the part of its readers (read my review of \"A Game of Thrones\", if you like), we're naturally pretty impatient.  I'm not sure Martin quite appreciates that.\n\nAll that rambling aside, \"A Feast for Crows\" IS a good book, perhaps not as emotionally taut as \"A Storm of Swords\", but still well worth buying.", "New Album: The Makers - The Makers [Estrus] [1995] http://t.co/rW2xjYpK04", "Meh, tape does not seem to stick very well.

What I was hoping for was something akin to Anne Applebaum's \"Gulag\": a one-volume history of what happened, how it happened, why it happened, and how it was dealt with when it was over. This book is certainly not that.\n\nInstead, Gilbert has taken an enormous amount of first-hand experiences and arranged them chronologically to tell an almost day-by-day account of the unfathomable brutality experienced by European Jewry. To weave this all together in such a way is masterful, but it only tells a part of the story. I assume that was his goal, but it leaves me wanting more.\n\nEvery paragraph has some episode that is unforgettable. It easy to lose sight of the fact that the 6 million murders took place, as Judith Miller says, \"one by one by one.\" This book makes sure you'll never think of the Holocaust that way again. What Gilbert neglects to cover in much detail is the Nazi part of the story. Of course they are front and center as the perpetrators, but little is covered about what ordinary Germans knew. Or how the German culture was ripe ground for this evil to blossom. Or what the millions of valuables stolen were used for. Or how the manpower and resources expended in this psychopathic venture affected the overall war effort. Or what role, outside of Eichmann, those at the top of the Nazi command played. Again, Gilbert obviously wasn't trying to tell that part of the story, but I still can't say I have a true understanding of the Holocaust beside the unbelievable cruelty so many suffered.\n\nAnd, this makes me angry at myself, at 828 pages, after a while, you become numb to it all. I stopped being shocked by what I read. I think this is unfortunate, but natural. A topic like this is so ghastly that, the further we get from WWII, the less people will know about it. In our comfortable American lives, people don't want to remember these awful events of the past.\n\nTwo quotes sum it all up for the book: one tells the utter desperation of an entire culture, the other the unyielding faith that so many held until the very end:\n\n\"There is no strength left to cry, steady and continued weeping leads finally to silence.

I pre-ordered it a while ago (before I even had GTA3), because the story of the game sounded very interesting to me.\nBasically, a corporation has somewhat taken control of your country, and you are fighting back.\nThere are four areas where I feel this game does better than GTA:\n-Hand to hand combat.  The hand to hand combat is great.  This is how GTA3 should have been.  If you get attacked by 6+ \"cops\", you have a decent chance of actually beating them and getting away.  I felt that this was lacking in GTA3.\n-Overall movement controls.  They did something very key in this game.  If you have ever played Oni, you will know what I am talking about.  They got rid of the crappy right analog \"look\" controls and replaced them with a \"panning\" type of controls.  This means that you can control the direction they are running  and easily stay behind the character with the right analog control.  It is complicated, but after some practice, you will get it.  The left analog is still the same as GTA3, which differs from Oni.  This makes the experience much more enjoyable.\n-Better multitasking.  They really crammed a lot of rioters on the screen withough sacrificing much in the way of graphics.  The graphics are a little more cartoon like in this game, but they must have 3x the number of people on the screen all running around and doing stuff.  Some of you may know this is hard for them to do without slow down...  What I think they may have done is make the characters \"dumb.\"  All they really do is run around.  Some of them carry stuff or cower in fear, but that is all.  If you attack them (which you aren't supposed to) they won't fight back.  Randomly they will shout a profanity if you bumb into them.\n-Multiple charcaters.  you can play as different people.\n-----\nThe game isn't as fun as GTA3 though.  There is not much character development, and no movies at all.  I have only played for a few hours, but it is lacking a lot of detail so far.  It falls way behind GTA3 in every other category besides the above mentioned.  For instance:\n-Dull missions.  Boring...  Nothing much here... retrieve these plans, kill these people... same stuff over and over...\n-Don't hurt pedestrians...  You actulally lose points for hurting non cops.\n-No cars.  Can't steal cars or drive them\n-No movies... Non at all so far... When you talk to people to get missions, it just comes up as text on the screen.  LAME\n-Lack of overall detail... just isn't there.\nYou get the idea... If you are GTA freak and need more, this might be the right place.  It isn't the same game though, so don't expect GTA4 from this title, it might get boring fast for you.  Rockstar is still an amazing company though.  They have other great titles to check out if you haven't... Oni and Max Payne are both better than this game in my opinion.\nI would give it 2.5 stars if I could...

One specific fault I found with the plot is that, for supposedly \"emotionless\" creatures, these children sure get upset pretty easily. From what I could ascertain, much of the original idea of the story was to raise questions about mankind's inability to accept the unknown, and Reverend George (Mark Hamill) keeps the film consistent with this idea. The heroes, such as they are, consist of Allen Chaffee (Christopher Reeve), Jill McGowan (Linda Kozlowski), Frank McGowan (Michael Par), and Doctor Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley). The last of these characters is a modern addition to the story that holds little rhyme nor reason except to modernize the script a touch, much like the more explicit violence and speech of this 1995 production. The bad guys are a group of white-haired children who sit around doing nothing a lot on a farmhouse for years until someone finally decides that there's something not quite normal about them and that they Must Be Stopped.\n\nNot having seen the original 1960 production of this film, I cannot really comment on whether this is the best version of the film that one can lay out their thirty dollars for. However, if there is one thing that director John Carpenter does well, it is to take old horror stories and bring them into the modern age, albeit with variable results. Much of this film is unintentionally funny, and much of it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, but the whole sense of this on-screen town being doomed is carried well enough to make for an entertaining film. It is also worth noting that this is the last film Christopher Reeve appeared in before he was paralysed from the neck down in a horse-riding accident, a truly sad situation given his commanding presence as an actor. I personally liked Village Of The Damned according to John Carpenter.

So after they'd scarfed down everything that I'd combined with their favorite Wellness, Dave's or Nutro flavors, I tried combining raw with this food. They didn't exactly turn up their noses, but all of them picked out the raw and left some of the canned. And the leftovers sat much longer than usual.

Amazon now carries them and so do other retailers, so there is no reason to buy this ridiculously expensive record I've reviewing here, unless you're insane and are willing to pay just for the cool looking cover!  The covers on the new box-sets are nice photographs of Bernstein himself.  Be that as it may, I'm not a fan of Bernstein's Mahler records from the 1980's, his earlier renditions were better, it's just that these 80's DG records have much better sound with which his earlier ones can't compete.\n\nAs for this performance itself. it is not a good entry into the world of Mahler's Resurrection Symphony.  This is a long, bloated, elephantine performance that would make even Mahler scoff.  However if you already have other, more standard versions of this work, say for instance the Zubin Mehta or the Klemperer recording, then you can appreciate Bernstein's unique view for itself.  Obviously it's a distortion of Mahler's music, but hey, Bernstein is a compelling musician and this can be a fun ride in and of itself, I just recommend you have other versions of this symphony before this one.\n\nThis work typically runs 82 minutes or so, Bernstein stretches it out to 94 minutes and it is very much a daunting task to sit through this recording.  The first movement is 25 minutes long where Mehta's famous version clocks in at 21.  The inner movements are not heavily distorted tempo wise, but they do sound leaden, like you want to smack Lenny and tell him to get moving.  But the last movement is an unheard of 38:42! Mehta's for comparison is 33 and a half.\n\nThis is Bernstein pouring on the heavy schmaltz and adding whipped cream with a cherry on top of a mountain of chocolate sauce.  But there are benefits to Bernstein's kitschy approach, right?  Indeed, well mostly in the finale with the chorus, Bernstein really lets loose with a massive crescendo of cathedral like sound, possibly the best I've heard so far of the final moments.  You do of course have to deal with the rest of this performance which I find uniquely boring and uninvolving, leading to big climaxes here and there but remaining stagnant for the most part.\n\nIf you must have this performance, do what I did and buy it in the inexpensive 6CD set which contains Symphonies 1, this number 2, 3, 4, Das Knaben Wunderhorn and Lieder eines\nfahrenden Gesellen, all stemming from the 1980's DG cycle.", "Looks great.

I picked this up because it is part of the PBS Masterpiece series this summer.  I had some idea of what I was getting into from the PBS previews, but I didn't have a full understanding of what type of book it would be.  It was kind of boring.  The most interesting parts were those I picked up on from watching the tv teasers.  The story follows Ross Poldark as he returns home from the Revolutionary War to England.  He is expecting to sweep his girlfriend off her feet and marry her except she is now engaged to his cousin.  The story also follows a variety of other characters in Cornwall, including Poldark's servants, tenants, his tin mining endeavors, and his extended family.  I think I was suppose to get a sense of place and time more than anything.  There are lots of descriptions of scenery and people.  The story was slowly paced and meandered from character to character and conflict to conflict.  It almost felt more like a collection of short stories about this group of people and a place.  It is that style combined with drowsy prose that left me feeling like I was reading something assigned to me more than I was reading for pleasure.  There was also a lot of dialect that irritated me.  I completely understood its function and purpose in a book about class and society, but it still wore me out.  This is definitely the prose and style of another era, and I think many modern readers will struggle with a work that is less driven by plot or characters than by setting.  I did stick this one out, and I will give PBS a shot to convince me that their version is more than a cure for my insomnia.  I was satisfied by the events in the only plot that I cared about - Ross's love life.

I expected a game that had a trailing camera with good graphics, interesting combat, and an engaging storyline. I came away disappointed.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect of the game is the combat engine. Instead of a realtime hand-to-hand combat system, combat is turn-based. This in itself is not a problem. However, when engaged in combat, the participants run forward, take a swing, and run back. They take turns doing this until someone drops. The whole scenario comes across almost like a game of turn-based bumper cars.\n\nAnother issue with combat is the unexpected encounters that occur. In the opening stages of the game, the character must wander about in the woods, and very frequently the travel is interrupted by a message to prepare for combat. Often, that there are enemies nearby is a surprise as they do not show until the battle is joined. This kind of encounter occurs throughout the game.\n\nCombat is often imbalanced as well. It is too easy to die.\n\nThe dialog options are somewhat uninspired as well, and the main character frequently talks to herself when trying to interact with inanimate objects. This is disconcerting, if nothing else.\n\nThere are good and bad aspects to the graphics. The graphics engine itself is good, and the rendered graphical images are very pretty and inspiring. There is plenty of eye candy in this game for those that like pretty graphics and lots of detail. However, one aspect of the graphics that is frustrating is the changing camera perspective. It switches automatically from a side view to a top-down view depending on area transitions, and in the top-down view it is difficult to tell where the player is going and what is in the surrounding area.\n\nThe storyline itself is engaging, and the developer did a nice job with it. Some of the side quests leave much to be desired, though, so it is a mixed bag in terms of gameplay.\n\nIf I had to compare it to other games in the same general genre, I would describe it as a hybrid mix between Dungeon Siege and Arcanum. Unfortunately it borrows a little too heavily from Arcanum's pitfalls.\n\nI came away disappointed with this title. It has some good ideas and concepts that have been incorporated into it, but the implementation of those ideas make it less than ideal. Some players may find this game to be a refreshing change from 1st-person style gaming, but I found it to be clunky and awkward.

The hero, William Stanton, is charged with sleuthing around to find the connection between Providence, Rhode Island and the World of the Dead. Stanton is an archaeologist by trade, and he is very young, fairly naive, very polite, and very determined. I liked playing from this character's perspective. And the idea that there is a dark underside to such a quaint and seemingly peaceful town is provocative, and appeals to my everpresent suspicion that all is not as it seems.\nThe first half of the game is preoccupied with unraveling the mystery around Stanton's friend, Edgar Wicherly. Wicherly brings Stanton a pyramid-shaped stone and tells him to give it to no one, \"not even me!\" This portion of the game is quite riveting---the graphics in the town are quite nice with fairly involved detailing. Stanton's task is to explore what has happened to Wicherly, and what kind of research he has been doing to provoke such odd behavior. The eerieness is well-developed by the odd behavior and taciturnity of the towns folk.\nThere is a stretch of game where I was literally terrified---I confess to being so absorbed by the storyline and graphics that at times I could not bring myself to press the cursor on the hotspot for fear of what might happen next (at one point I got up from my chair and stood behind it to press the cursor---something about doing this made me break the hold the narrative had over me). Really great work here---the designers have a good sense of what is really terrifying, in a Blair Witch tradition.\nThere are some moments of broken story logic (it seems to me) having to do with the central scene in the middle of the game. There is an implausible moment in the storyline, which affects my relationship to the main character (I refrain from revealing the details). Nonetheless, the story picks up from that moment and shifts into an entirely different world apart from the dreamy Rhode Island setting. I think I would have remained more engaged had the story stuck to the Rhode Island space a little more, giving a more palpable sense that the other side is much more integrally connected to the world in which all the characters live and breathe. As it is, the game is separated into \"The Rhode Island Segment\" and \"The Other World Segment.\" It loses some of its efficacy because of this for me.\nThe game is puzzle-heavy, to an astonishing degree, particularly in the second half. Rather than bog myself down in frustrating solutions, I opted to find a good walkthrough for the puzzles. There are also several mazes, which are slightly less frustrating, and on which I usually did not cop out by going to the walkthrough. There is some interesting alchemical work, as well as some fairly engaging library work (Stanton follows the path of many a researcher in just such a library). It seems to me that the facts and details of the storyline are fairly historically plausible, if not accurate.\nI give this game 3 stars because the first half is so engaging--for its narrative development, voice acting (the newspaper man at the Gazette is a memorable delivery), measured eerieness, and logical sleuthing. It gets no more than 3 stars because the second half fails to sustain the enjoyment of the first half--the story loses plausibility and connection to the first half, it is almost all puzzles and mazes with no non-player character interaction, and even though it takes place \"on the underside,\" it is slightly less eery than the disturbed world of Rhode Island.", "It 's my new perfume .

Apparently, however, there was some re-recording done by Robertson and others to \"clean up\" the originals, plus the Band-only songs are mostly from totally different, much later sessions. Of course, being too much of a purist here is counterproductive anyway, as many of the songs most identified with the basement were actually recorded elsewhere, at places like the \"red room\" at Dylan's house.\n  Some of the best moments in the \"basement\" were incomplete versions of songs, and these are always ignored here in favor of more complete, though sometimes inferior, versions (\"Too Much Of Nothing\" & \"Nothing Was Delivered\" come to mind). And then, of course, there are \"I'm Not There\", \"Sign On The Cross\" and others that are completely absent. Not to mention, of course, some really fun stuff like \"...Allen Ginsberg\" & \"The Spanish Song\" that not only show how much fun everybody was having, but also the volume of substances they were consuming.\n  Even some of the better versions that were used here don't have the impact of the original, pre-\"cooked\" versions. \"Goin' To Acapulco\" virtually jumps out of the speakers at you in Garth Hudson's original mix, for example, where this official release version sounds relatively limp by comparison.\n  So, by all means, purchase this if you are looking for an easily obtainable sampling of what went on in that basement (and elsewhere) 42 years ago. If, however, you are a serious Dylan listener, or a student of modern popular music, then you must hear the complete sessions that are available only on \"unofficial\" releases. \"The Genuine Basement Tapes\" was the standard for many years, but is of inconsistent quality despite its completeness.

However, plan on replacing it fast. It's cheap for a reason and it feels cheap. With guitars, you get what you for up to a certain price point. This is an OK starter guitar for someone who may not have the drive or patience.\n\nIf you're looking at this as a first guitar and you plan on playing, learning, practicing then pass on this. Epiphone makes great guitars and for double the price you get a much better feeling and sounding instrument. I've played on more than of these and a common issue is staying in tune and not sounding right in anyrhing but standard tuning. For examoleexample, if you want to learn metal this guitar will not satisfy you.\n\n The epiphone les paul standard, typically around $300 is where you should go. They fret easier and sound richer. You may also want to check out a fender telecaster modern player around the same price. It's a different feel due to the maple fretboard and really is fantastic for chords - where all beginners should start anyway.\n\nI've gone through a number of guitars since I bought one of these. The lesson learned is when you get to the $300 - $500 you'll get quality not only in build but in comfort and tone.\n\nI love epiphone, but depending on your level of interest in the guitar this particular model may be something to pass on. Go put your hands on one of these at guitar center and then compare to a slightly more expensive lp standard. There's a difference and it does matter. Try various models and pick the one that fits your hands, your body, and whispers \"buy me\". Craigslist is full of blind buys for a reason.", "There is a review where the author advised to try to figure out the cause of the plucking. That's correct. However it's very difficult because requires you observe close the bird and also remember if some change in the environment preceded the symptom. Other causes could be boredom, small cage, being confined in the cage all day, lack of space or variety of toys, loneliness or somebody the bird was attached is no longer there, fear, lack of interaction from the owner (note that some birds are shy and takes a little while to get close to them).\n\nAnything can cause plucking. You need to work in each of the possible causes and start to isolate one by one (or could be several).\n\nThere is a medicine the kings cage sell to help (not to solve) in the treatment of feather plucking which is the 'plucking no more'. I never tried but I bought other things from this website and I'm happy.\n\nAnother website you want to reach out is  'my safe bird store'.  If the problem is boredom, for sure you'll find all kind of things for your bird to be distracted even tree stand if you like to leave your bird on a indoor java tree and not behind the bars of a cage. Toys they have tons and for a wonderful price. Food I receive good quality and price.\n\nYou may also want to look for a little cape they make only for birds. This cape is like a little shirt for birds that help to cover their body from plucking (of course, it's a fabric and the bird can chew, but if the bird isn't in a warm place I believe this solution also is valid for the plucking treatment).\n\nThe bitter spray I don't like it. You can try and spray on your skin, that taste won't go away and I think is more cruel spray in the body of the bird which can absorb that and the bird will taste that thing all day long even when not plucking. If I was a bird and have this taste on my mouth I would chew everything in front of me to try to take the taste away. Not sure if it happen with the bird, but so far I try things like that before applying to any of my pets.\n\nI would understand spraying the bitter apple in a furniture on a frame the bird persist on chewing (still, don't like so much this idea), but never spray on the pet itself. I already think it is too cruel let the pet have the bitter taste for long time and much more if you spray the solution on the pet skin.\n\nAppropriate training and providing several chewing toys is the best option for destructive birds.

Just small rub marks around plastic painted frame of the clock. Mine was more of an antique bronze color than silver.  I did not deem that bad enough to return, but more of a quality issue.\n\nMy main problem was with how the clock adjusted time.  It was supposed to adjust to the radio wave time and then, you push the button of the time zone you are in.  This happened and I pushed ET for eastern time.  The clock then moved itself 2 hours past the actual east coast time.  If it had been off by only one hour, I would have been sure it was a DST (daylight savings time) issue and there is a tiny unmarked button to fix that.  But my clock was off by 2 hours.  This caused a real curiosity and so far I fixed it by selecting MT mountain time, even though I am on the east coast.  The clock then moved the time to the correct east coast time.  Not sure what to do about all of that.  But clock so far seems to be working on Mountain Time.\n\nAll in all, I kind of wish I had paid more and gotten the SEIKO outdoor clock here on amazon.

But in the long term  the opposite was true.\n\"You have to be very physically active in order to keep the weight off  \" Hall  said.\n Hall 's findings echo previous studies that promote more exercise for long-term weight loss maintenance. However  experts caution that doesn't mean people can neglect their diets in the long run  either.\nThis method  however  was not able to tell how much of the physical activity was due to normal daily activities -- like cleaning the house or walking the dog -- versus following a workout plan   Hall  said.\nSix years later  however  the contestants' resting metabolisms still hadn't sped back up   Hall  showed in a study last year.\nFor  Hall   metabolic changes are just one part of the puzzle. Genetics may also play a role  as well as social factors that can make it hard for some people to incorporate so much exercise in their daily lives.\n Hall  added that it's not necessarily those who were most physically active during the competition who kept it up six years later.", "Okay, first things first.  Comparing this film to the future that so far has developed is absurd.  If people weren't so narrow minded in their appreciation of fiction, they could have set this movie in modern day NYC or Tokyo.  But people would be confused; \"Robots don't have skin.  Does this take place in the future?\"  Also, it gives the filmmakers an excuse to build exaggerated set designs and executing all kinds of visuals that otherwise would need to be \"realistic\" or be accompanied by a narrator to explain their presence.\nWith that aside,\nThe script and its corresponding visuals start out strong, and then, to my mind, gets bogged down in a siege of hardcore detective work.  I would assume in this instance that detective work does eventually lead somewhere, but I was a bit lost on what exactly he was looking for and how he came to the hypothesis that he was anywhere other than right where he started.  Also -- it's a second hand assumption that the detective work in this film is going to lead somewhere.  If one was not familiar with the concept of a story based movie, one would not have any reason to assume this.  Often, in reality, detective work, although a valuable thing, the fact is that detectives do not always find what they are looking for and the cases they are hired to solve often end up unfinished.  There is nothing happening during Indiana Jones/Han Solos' detective work except the introduction of characters who we learn nothing about and whose presence serves nobody except the screenwriter and the director.  The audience is expected to have such minimal expectations of a movie that they will have their jaw open in awe during all of this or insist on \"seeing it through\" until the end when they see how it all connects.  That's reality.  Thistles and thorns and a delicious meal afterward.  I'm not going to pay someone to deliver me a plate of uncooked fish.  I'll toil the land if i need to.  I don't need to watch this or any other movie.\nThis film isn't terrible.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying this is far from a 5 star film.  There are much better ways to spend a Friday at the multiplex or home theater.  But if you've already seen them and can't think of something else to do that you're willing to, then...perhaps try this.", "I wasn't daunted by the all-Japanese instructions--- what do I need instructions for, having (more or less) successfully applied several screen protectors to various phones? This one is more expensive than the others, and I hesitated before buying it, for that reason and because there's only one (where others are sold in 3-packs). But I'm a veteran user, and the reviews are good, so what the heck?\n\nFirst impressions were good: the protector itself feels sturdy and looks clear, and it ships with a nice microfiber cloth big enough to swaddle a small infant. I donned vinyl gloves, carefully wiped my phone down in preparation, lined up the protector, and made contact. ZAP. It fell into place and adhered instantly, without a single bubble, as though it had melted onto the glass. Perfect!\n\nWell, almost. Actually a millimeter or two out of place, enough that I was concerned the camera lens might be obscured. No problem, I'd just peel and reapply... or so I thought. I skitched and scratched with my fingernail, first with and then without the glove, trying to peel any of the corners up, but they were stuck fast. I finally did get a corner up, but in the process it curled. When I reapplied the film, the screen was littered with bubbles and the peeled corner refused to lay flat. Chased most of the bubbles away, but an obstinate pocket right in the center of the screen compelled me to lift the film and reapply it a THIRD time, which turned out to be the breaking point.\n\nI stared in frustration at the dog-eared corner and the Swiss-cheeselike array of bubbles, cursing bitterly, and then admitted defeat (by violently ripping the screen protector from my phone and hurling it as far as I could across the room, which wasn't very far).\n\nSo, that's that.

Then powered off the unit, hooked up the two switched lines (hot/compressor), then powered back on. Finally! Success! The unit works exactly like it was supposed to, after two other bad units.

A departure in terms of gameplay and design for Capcom's long running survival horror franchise, Resident Evil 4 marked the best entry in the series, as well as the best survival horror game of all time when it was first released on the Gamecube.  Eventually the game would be released on the PS2 (and recently the excellent version that just came out for the Wii), and now it's finally on the PC.  Sadly though, so much of what made Resident Evil 4 so great on the consoles has been lost in translation in this port to the PC, making PC gamers wonder what all the fuss was about with Resident Evil 4 in the first place.  While the game still features it's ultra creepy atmoshphere and heart pounding moments of suspense, the fact that the game cannot be played with a mouse is pure blasphemy.  A controller is essential here because of that, and the fact that the keyboard controls are sloppy and annoying to boot.  Once you get over that hurdle, you'll find that despite the atmosphere of the game, the cut-scenes and even some other parts look incredibly blurry and stilted.  You can't play around with the visuals of Resident Evil 4 either, and considering how long this PC version of the game was in development, the overall package just feels rushed.  Not to mention that this PC port features no new exclusive content either.  All the negatives aside though, Resident Evil 4 for the PC is still pretty much the Resident Evil 4 we all know and love, and if you own a gamepad, there's plenty of excitement to be found here.  Combine that with the budget price tag, and you still get a solid survival horror game that is worth a look.  That is, if you don't own a console.  If you own one of the aforementioned console systems, pick Resident Evil 4 up for that system, but if you don't, well then, this PC version loses much of what made the console game so great in the first place.", "I bought 3 of these.
