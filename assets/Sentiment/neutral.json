            "Edit: After owning this ring for 2 weeks, I had to go update my review. I still love the ring design and price point. However, as I noted in my original review, I have bad metal allergies. This is not pure stainless steel. I have other stainless steel jewelry that I can wear for days on end with no issues. I wore this ring several days in a row, removing it at night, and I began breaking out from where the metal was in contact with my finger. I'm not sure if it is the antiquing or if the steel is plated to make it a shinier silver. Whatever it is, it is definitely not pure stainless steel. Such a shame. At least I can wear this once in a while when I need a nicer looking ring. I have bad metal allergies and can only safely wear a few metals, making jewelry nearly impossible to find. Stainless steel is one of my few safe metals, so I have been searching for more right hand rings in steel. I decided to try this ring as I love roses and this fit my simplistic style well. I just got it tonight and love it. I ordered a 7, and it is a perfect fit. It has a low profile to my finger. I wear it with the vine to the top of my hand, and even still it goes almost from my middle joint to my top knuckle. It stays put well and doesn't slide around. And it has a very solid feel to it. It does not look like a $10 ring at all, but it was worth the price.",

Why couldn't Rebecca get her fair fixed in a pleasing style, learn to apply makeup and buy decent clothes so she didn't look frumpy?  She bemoans feeling like no one likes her, yet does nothing but whine instead of fixing herself up.  Same way with Eric.  Just didn't make sense to play the \"loser card\" when there was so much they could have done to enjoy life more.

            "I recall really liking this back in the early 90s. In fact, at the time, it made my top ten Christmas film list. Boy, does reviewing previous reviews make a dif! My wife liked this one, too, so we added it to one of our yearly Christmas film purchases (we pickup a few each year) and where it's definitely entertaining and Michael Caine does a very good job as Ebenezer Scrooge, this is just one more decent filmed version of Charles Dickens' story \"A Christmas Carol\", along with the 1970 musical version \"Scrooge\", the 1938 MGM version, and 1969 Hanna-Barbera Australian animated TV version. However, these are all heads and shoulders over the recent Disney \"animated\" version, with Jim Carrey (awful!) and the other Disney short, \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" (below average), not to mention the overbearing \"Scrooged\" with Bill Murray. It's worth adding to our collection (if nothing else, the menu, with Kermit, cracks us up). But I find, as I age, I have less and less interest in Jim Henson. I grew up with the original Sesame Street on TV and was a preteen when 'The Muppet Show' debuted, as well. Perhaps these are better for adolescents? Looking for a good version of Scrooge? Look no further than the 1951 British version, with plenty of atmosphere and shot in beautiful black and white. There's a beautiful animated short by Richard Williams also, from '71, which offers some extremely mysterious animation techniques. Very impressive, but not available on dvd, at least commercially.",

Her encounter with both the subjects of her search in the same place and her ... but I will say no more, so as to not give away precious plot points.

            "That would be 'War of the Godfathers',a supposedly non-fiction book but seems mostly fiction to me. Roemers best would be his first book,'Roemer:Man Against the Mob'. His last book of his Chicago Outfit books,'Accardo:the Genuine Godfather',is probably a little better than his Spilotro book. If you're interested in Anthony Spilotro,the best would probably be Dennis Griffens' book on Frank Cullotta. This mostly covers the Vegas era when Spilotro represented the Outfit. The problem with most of Roemers books is that they seem to be mostly about Bill Roemer and the wonderful J.Edgar Hoover;a man that Bill seems to idolize unconditionally. Probably self denial on Roemers part. But you have to remember when this book was written,Hoover was still a venerated legend. If we knew then what is now known about J. Edgar,would Bill have been as worshipful;who knows? But once you get past this,it's not too bad as far as mob books go. There are a lot worse. By most accounts Bill was fine agent. Anyone that can get under Momos' skin the way Bill did can't be too bad.",

            "Disclaimer: This is my first set of headphones since my days of the walkman in the 80s.  I am a bit of an audiophile and I have a pretty capable system for vinyl and CDs/hi-rez audio.  I bought these for use on my computer for editing my vinyl rips.  I have a Schiit Modi 2 Multi-bit DAC and a Schiit Valhalla 2 tube amp powering these.  They're very decent pieces of equipment.  Anyway, I would just say that my impressions of headphone listening differ from many.  You don't get a \"soundstage\" like you get from speakers.  The sound is literally in your head.  And if the imaging is well placed, it's BEHIND your head.  It's just....weird.  And a$$-backwards.  But that in and of itself is not the fault of the HD600s - at least I don't think it is.  What is it's fault is the lack of bass.  I'd read some amazing reviews about how awesome the bass was through these.  I mean, they do kick a little, but they just don't extend nearly as low as I would have expected.  Also, the highs are a bit bright for my tastes.  If I crank them up, every cymbal crash has me reaching for the volume knob FAST.  I love the sound of crash cymbals (I played drums for 15 years growing up, so I know how cymbals should sound) but these make them unbearable in their bright attack.  The reason I'm so hard on these is I literally have better sound listening through my (cheap) Creative T40 speakers.  Yes, they lack lack the bass (it's actually teri-bad).  But the mids and highs far exceed the capability of these headphones.  And with the Schiit, they make them the schiit!  A huge jump up in accuracy from when I had my Creative Audigy Sound Card doing the DA conversion.  The Schiit took a $125 pair of speakers and made them sound like $500+ speakers.  Imaging is very 3D, the sound fuller and the timbre of instruments is almost laughably good for such a cheap pair of speakers.\n\nI compared my SACD layer of Bowie's Ziggy Stardust this weekend.  And the punch of the kick drum and slam of the snare on \"Five Years\" were much more involving through the T40s.  But what the deal breaker was is the timbre.  It sounded much more natural through my T40s.  The HD600s added an edge to it all.  Like enhanced (fake) treble.  It was very disappointing.... Each song had the same kind of traits.  All were too treble-boosted through the Sennheisers.  But in fairness, the bass was much better through them.  Although not deep.  I could go on and on but I'll quit here.",

            "I usually review cd's, but I decided to review this one, since the whole RE series is so damn cool.  Also, yes. I have this game and have been playing it for over a week now. I'm sick of seeing people putting in reviews before the release date. I've also read a lot of the other reviews. It's funny how one person raves about it and gives it five stars, while another person hates it and doesn't even think it deserves one star. I guess it's just a matter of taste, huh? Anyway...\nAnyone that owns a PS2 of course would be excited about any RE game finding its way onto their platform. So, naturally I scooped it up, post-haste. The first recommendation I have to make is don't buy this game without the strategy guide. I was completely lost and couldn't make it past the first scenario. I got as far as the rooftop before I considered returning the game. The guide helps a lot. Otherwise, you'll constantly be backtracking, going back to places you were sure you explored every inch of.\nAs far as the online gameplay goes, I don't have it. I'm still in the stone ages with my slow as molasses dial up. So, I can't comment on that.\nThe game goes back to Raccoon City. I don't really have a problem with that because the only other RE game I played is Code Veronica. Ok, confession time. I only started getting into the games after the movie came out. Yeah, go ahead. Call me a poser fan if you want.\nThe first major disappointment was the movement. After Code Veronica, I fully expected all the bugs to be worked out. I was looking forward to 360 degree camera turnarounds and zooming in and out capabilities, just like most PS2 games now. But, no. They still have it set up so when you move to the edge of the camera, there's a new shot. Come on! Video games have come a lot further than that. Get rid of the 2D crap!\nThe other annoying thing is the other players you have to babysit. The only good thing about that is you can trade items, but what happened to item boxes? Unless you're playing as the asian girl, you can only hold 4 items. to hold anymore, you have to discard something. Plus, although there are typewriters, they're not really save points. It only halts the game until you decide to play again. If you die, you still have to start the whole scenario over again. I know a lot of people have said it, but I have to agree. The loading times and waiting times between rooms is atrocious.\nWell, there are good points to the game, the first being the selection of characters. Because there are only 5 scenarios to complete, it's fun to complete them with the different people. Also, the graphice are dramatically improved. There is also more of a variety of weapons and other items, as well as combat moves.\nOverall, I expected better from this game. Ihey could have made more improvements, considering what's out there now. On the other hand, any addition to my RE collection is a good one. I do suggest renting this one first, since the reviews have been so mixed. I can't tell for sure if this is a flop or a hit for the hardcore fans.",

A renewed cinematic reinterpretation? or as is the case of Tim Burton, as I suspect, a long life dream to pay hommage to a book/ film he greatly admires?\nNo matter what the reason is, it is surely a venture wrought with difficulties from the start. How many adaptations or remakes have succeeded more than the original? very few, even the ones that are adapted from a foreign film, and as a result don't have popular recognition, have invariably failed to capture the originality or power of the first film, whether the adaptation/remake is copied frame by frame,(Assasins, Vanilla Sky, Birdcage etc...) or 'inspired by'.\nThe original Planet of the Apes was certainly a classic masterpiece..A beautiful piece of moviemaking that has a lot to offer than mere entertainment. The film has has such an impact on audiences, and spawned many sequels and a TV series, that to remake it, even by an able and creative director like Tim Burton, will whether it is an actual remake or a different adaptation of Boulle's classic book, it will be associated with the original.\nI could not watch this new version without thinking of the original, and this is why I did not appreciate it so much.\nThe casting is very good, and Walhberg is indeed a good actor, but Estella Warren was somehow miscast as the beautiful female 'savage' turned Walhberg side-kick. She is too distractingly beautiful and fresh to be her intended character, and I expected her, whenever she was in a close up to advertise for some shampoo or beauty product.\nThe make up is great though, and the DVD is packed with extras.\nYet something remains missing from the film. The sheer power and philosophical undertones, the harshness and apocalyptic atmosphere of the first.\nAlthough Burton's ending of his film is quite clever, it remains somehow a bit polished to have the same power as the scene that confronted Heston and with him the viewers in the first Planet of Apes.\nYou can certainly still enjoy this film, only if you manage not to think of the original Planet of the Apes, something I found very hard to do, and for that reason I was disappointed, and hope that Hollywood, the movie industry and film makers would rethink their strategy and method whenever they remake or adapt a film that is a classic.(Dr Zhivago was recently remade for British TV and flopped instantly!)..and remember it is indeed extremely hard task.",

It's almost like the Tamrac engineers think that photographers only stand straight up, don't walk or climb, and never set their bags down.\n\nBattery storage does seem to work okay though.\n\nA sidenote, there is a pocket the length of the wallet behind the right side. So you can put little things in here, like maybe a card-reader.

            "\"Next Position Please\" is an interesting album. As far as songs go there are some great ones on here. However, as far as production goes, it is not so good. Todd Rundgren, who produced the album wanted to get Cheap Trick away from Whoish-bomb-bast, and strip them down to barebones. There are some moments where this works, like on, \"Won't Take No For an Answer,\" Invaders of the Heart,\" and the title track but most of the time it just falls flat on it's face. What \"Next Postion Please\" needed was stronger production, dare I say fuzzy guitars, and fat walking basslines Instead we get washed out guitar sounds, and tiney sounding bass lines. Having heard the majority of these songs live I can say that they were made to be played loud, and fast, not slow and restrained.(To see, or rather hear, what I mean listen to the live version of \"I Can't Take It, for 1999's Music for Hangovers).\nAlso their label, Epic, started to flex their muscles on the creative control aspects of things by forcing the band to cover The Motors' \"Dancing the Night Away.\" I believe it was either \"record this song or we shelve the album\". I have heard the songs that were thrown off this album for \"Dancing the Night Away\", and it just goes to prove that at that time, and probably now, record execs have not a clue about what is good and bad, only what they think will sell -- and most of the time they are well off the mark on both. Maybe if record companies like Epic nutured bands and tried to develop them instead of using the assembly line approach with them, then the record industry would not be in the sad and sorry state they it is in now. Anyhoo, this could have been a classic, right up there with anything that the Rolling Stones or the Beatles did if produced right, instead it is a mixed bag of great songs produced wrong. I have always said that if Cheap Trick could come out with an album of songs as good as the ones on Next Position Please, with the strong production of All Shook Up, it would be a wonder to behold, well check out their self titled album from 1997 to see what I mean.",

Janny excelled at drawing me into the emotion of the characters.\n\n*** Spoilers ***\n\nI did not find it cool to show me a character with honorable quantities and motiviations -- very likeable -- only to totally subvert him through a curse given through an act of selfless sacrifice. To have a character turn so incredibly dark, twisted, and evil in that one instance was not credible for me.\n\nThe supposedly wise and powerful sorcerers made some really dumb decisions.\n\n* In Etara, surrounded by danger and malice, to leave Lysaer alone while he drank with the enemy -- stupid.\n\n* When they found Lysaer at the house, knowing there was a problem, they took entirely too long to break down the door to retrieve him. They could have averted most of the trouble had they managed to take possession of him at that time when they had the chance.\n\n* They trusted the drunk apprentice, Dakar, way too much freedom to get drunk and spill secrets or protect a prince, or hold an enemy under house arrest. And, each time he screwed it up.\n\n* With all that knowledge and power Asander was supposed to have, he couldn't stop Lysaer when he saw him on the balcony? He couldn't silence him? Or shield him? Or, render him unconscious? (sigh)\n\n* Once the sorcerers knew that the two princes would be going to war, they just left them alone??? I get that they had to take the mistwraith to the prison, but not all of them went. At least the two ghostly ones could have stayed to minimize the destruction.\n\n* Maybe this is just me, but I never got why Arithon had to give up music to be king. It was a huge part of the inner turmoil for the character, but for me at least it was never really explained why they're mutually exclusive. I get he couldn't be a bard and wander the kingdom, but why couldn't he just enjoy the music to bring him peace between battles and running a kingdom.\n\nIt was an engaging book and I lost a lot of productivity to reading it when I should have been working, but I don't know that I'll continue with the series for the reasons, above. It really was a frustrating read -- both to the difficult writing and the foolish plot decisions.",

He has even indicated in several conversations with a mysterious character simply known as \"The Blackbird\" that he used to smoke pot with Huston Smith and Jonathan Wells, and that he isn't sure whether hummingbirds really evolved from butterflies.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, this loony supported a proto-Cambodian Maoist outfit known as Vanguard Weatherman Organization (Bolshevik-Stalinist), who used to picket New Age bookstores with placards reading \"Nuke the transpersonalists\" , \"Feed Shirley MacLaine to the whales\" and \"Tibet belongs to China\". They also harassed people who attended the ashram of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh by throwing Mao's Little Red Book at them (something Bhagwan found very amusing).\n\nClearly, we are dealing with a crackpot from the bottomless pits of California!!!\n\nDon't be fooled if this \"Ash Tray\" Command wants to sell you something serious about the finance crisis, nuclear power or health care reform.

            "I'll let readers get a description of the book from the many other reviews posted here.  I give this three stars only because I think books like this should be enjoyed for what they are.  It's a colorful, fast read.  A beach book.\n\nBut as history it is about 80 percent nonsense.  Gregory credits Warnicke's The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn for the idea that Henry fell out of love with a thump because of the malformed fetus Anne aborted shortly before her arrest.  However, Gregory apparently did not read much else.  Among many, many facts in that book which Gregory chose to ignore was that Anne wasn't even brought back to court till early 1527, AFTER (and maybe because) Henry decided he must invalidate his marriage to Katherine.  Everybody, especially Anne's father, knew the King was on the lookout for a new wife before he got rid of the old one.  There is no doubt the King fell in love, but the depiction of Anne as a sexual schemer and Protestant revolutionary, and Henry as her victim, is simply Gregory's recycling of the slander memorialized by Nicholas Sander years after all the principals had died.  I think Anne deserves better than that.  She was a victim, just as all Henry's women were victims.  As for Mary, from whose point of view the story is told: She was never one of the Queen's maids (how could she be?  She was a married woman).  She was at court because her husband was one of the King's Gentlemen.  Her affair with the King was very brief, and she was packed off the moment it was known she had become pregnant, around May of 1525.  She and Anne were not even at court together.  So much for the value of history in \"historical\" fiction.  Why don't we just call it fiction and leave it at that?",

President Robert Mugabe as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for NCDs (non-communicable diseases) in Africa. As a result I have decided to rescind the appointment â  Tedros  said.\nâ Dr Tedros  deserves all our support to ensure  he  and WHO build a global health movement that is inclusive and works to improve health for everyone â Farrar said in a statement.",

I did figure out how to rewrite my @OFFSET calls to @INPUT calls - took a while.  This brings back memories of the Borland days of Quattro Pro - back then the spreadsheet would freeze sometimes when moving columns around.\n\nYou can tell from this that I care a lot about the compatibility of QP with Excel (I have to care).  Now if you don't care about compatibility then this is not an issue.\n\nOn the WordPerfect side - a long, long time ago I got my whole company (1,000 employees) to switch from DOS Wordstar to DOS WordPerfect.

It is fun seeing the relationship between Nash and Tod while they are both alive, and finally learn the details about how Tod died.  Plus there is an interesting twist at the very end that I'm betting will come into play in the future.\n\nFree is free, and it's fantastic that Rachel keeps releasing these free novellas, but my big disappointment is that after waiting this long to get inside Tod's head, he doesn't answer the questions I've been dying to know. REAPER doesn't go on long enough for Tod to see Kaylee.  I know he likes her, there have been too many hints for him to only think of her as Nash's girlfriend, but I was really hoping to learn how much.  I hope that maybe Rachel is planning on writing more from Tod's perspective, because this taste isn't enough.\n\nI would recommend not reading REAPER until after you've read MY SOUL TO STEAL as I think the introduction to Nash's ex-girlfriend and their relationship is better swallowed in the past tense.  In REAPER, it's more than a little unsettling to see Nash all Bonnie and Clyde with her.  More so if you haven't seen what happens in MY SOUL TO STEAL.  My suggestion is to download REAPER now while it's free and read it after MSTS releases on January 1st.\n\nSexual Content: Kissing.  References to sex.",

            "I had my eye on the LG VU for about a year now it seemed to be the closest thing to the iPhone without all of the ridiculous limitations, such as only being able to do file management by syncing with iTunes all the time, no BlueTooth capability (other than talking on the phone) and the ridiculous contract through AT&T wireless.  I had the iPhone for two days before returning it because after realizing it cost way too much money to be so limited.  As much as I disliked the iPhone, I did like some of its features like the touch screen and the internet capability.\nI had been using a cheap phone while I searched for one that would be worth dropping a few hundred dollars on.  The only one that came close was the LG VU, but even then I was hesitant because it did not have WAN capability like the  i-phone did and I knew the internet function of the VU came nowhere near to that of the iPhone.  But after my old phone stopped working completely, I had no choice but to get a new phone so I picked up the LG VU. (no contract of course).\n\nThe touch screen is fairly responsive, however there are many occasions if you have fairly large hands/fingers you will find yourself pressing the wrong button or letter on the fairly small on screen keyboard and will take some getting used to.  A huge problem with the LG's touch screen, is that is it not nearly as responsive as the iPhone when it comes to scrolling such as an internet page.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't at all.  In the cases when it does work it very inconsistent, sometimes it only scrolls a few millimeters and other time it scrolls entirely too fast and far causing you to have to start over.  This is extremely frustrating however, a small consolation is that you can use the volume keys to automatically move the next or previous page, but it does nothing if you want to scroll horizontally.  I don't know if the problems with the touch screen are a result of me having a screen protector on it, but I had a similar screen protector on the iPhone and still did not have any issues with its touch screen.\n\nSpeaking of the internet the LG Vu is nowhere near the internet of the iPhone.  Its slow, frequently unresponsive and some pages that came up on the iPhone with no problem don't come up at all on the LG Vu.  This is because the LG Vu does not use the \"real\" internet that the IPhone does.  The Vu uses the fairly limited Media.net version that most cell phones use meaning that it only works fairly well with the most basic of sites.  Anything complicated, even message boards are slow and many times unusable.  The iPhone's internet capabilities run circles around this phone.\n\nThe best feature of the LG VU is the feature I never had any plans to use at first.  This feature is the TV feature.  Basically it's just that; a feature that allows you to watch TV on your phone.  It works surprisingly well, but there are only a handful of channels to choose from, some examples are NBC, CBS, ESPN, CNN, FoxNews, MTV and Nickelodeon.  The news channels are \"Live\" but others play reruns of the previous day's shows.  There are cases where the picture/sound will freeze and become garbled, but for the most part is pretty good.  The TV feature can only be used if you pay for the service (about $30/month), but once you pay, its unlimited use.  Add another $5 to have unlimited Media.net usage.  There is also a cellular video feature allowing you to watch full length TV shows and sports but I haven't used it.\n\nOther than the touch screen, and TV feature the LG VU has the same features every other phone has; various Bluetooth services that are not limited to just voice such as the iPhone, music player, ability to use MP3's as ring tones, and 2MP camera phone used for taking stills and short videos.  The camera does not snap very good pictures as most of the time they come out blurry even though the image on the screen prior to taking the picture is quite clear.  The pictures are blurry even though I hold it perfectly still.  It seems the only time I get clearer pictures is when I'm moving slightly so I have no idea what is up with that.\n\nThe LG VU is not a bad phone but it could have been so much better.  It suffers greatly from not having WAN capability and the UI occasionally becomes unresponsive and freezes.  The internet interface though only using Media.net still could have been designed a lot better.  Had I not absolutely needed a phone, then I would have not gotten the LG VU, but since I didn't have one at all I had to make a decision.",

            "I'm beginning to see why high fantasy almost always takes place on an epic scale. The short volumes of the Chronicles of Narnia don't really give you a chance to live in the world and experience it. Prince Caspian is at its most winning when it revels in the past. When the children return to Narnia, they discover a world that has aged for a thousand years without them. It gave the place a feeling of weight and grandeur before the plot caught up with them.\n\nLike LWW, PC is a slight narrative heading towards a single, swift, decisive battle that will be easily won by Aslan after taking a moment to meditate on faith and God. The main thrust of the story is about restoring Prince Caspian to the throne of Narnia, usurped by his murderous uncle Claudius--I mean, Miraz. His plight is what summons the four children back to Narnia, and his backstory is the subject of a four-chapter flashback. No, really. This is only a fifteen chapter book. Roughly a quarter of the narrative is a single, unbroken flashback that doesn't involve any of the four children we're supposed to be following. This is not the least of the narrative issues I have with PC, but overall the book did surpass LWW. It was more engaging and the ending was less of a deus ex machina.\n\nAlso, the heroes are less useless in this book. Susan gets to use her bow (although she still isn't allowed to participate in combat). Peter and Edmund get their diplomacy on, but none of them have much of an arc. And Lucy... she is the main character of a Lewis-gets-preachy unnecessary subplot that really bothered me. Not because I'm anti-allegory (I'm not) and not because I'm anti-religion (I am, but I'm claiming objectivity), but because I hate sacrificing narrative cohesion for the sake of making an unnecessary point. While the group is trying to find Caspian, Aslan appears to Lucy and Lucy alone, bidding her to follow him. She mentions this to the group, but she's outvoted. The following night, she sees Aslan again, who seems to be irked that she didn't convince the others to follow him or, failing that, follow alone. He could have just appeared to all four children and been done with it. But instead, he chose to admonish the faithless for exercising otherwise sound judgement.\n\nI realize that for Lewis, this was probably meant to be a deep homily on the nature of faith. For me, it just points out what a jerk Aslan (and by extension God) can be. In case you hadn't picked up on this, I don't enjoy Aslan as a character. He shows up, bosses people around, and everyone thinks he's awesome. But aside from swooping in at the last minute to win battles, he doesn't do much apart from being mysterious and unapproachable. Think about it, he's almost completely unnecessary to the plot. His presence diminishes the actions of the children--who are the heroes of the story. He heals people and he rallies the troops, but he mostly just exists for Lewis to fawn over. This book (and its predecessor) could have been told without his physical presence, losing the painfully plot-halting allegory and making the heroes' deeds more heroic. Would have made for better books, in my opinion.\n\nOn the whole, I liked PC more than LWW. It felt lived in, more self-assured. I'm looking forward to where this series goes, but I've had it up to here with the darned lion.",

            "All the momentum that Ice & Fire had at the end of A Clash of Kings has now been sapped from the story. The characters are getting spread so far and thin that I am starting to lose interest. The plot has likewise become too large and thin. I was looking forward to this book moving the serious forward, but few questions are addressed, almost none are resolved, and more are given. Everything is pretty much the same as it was at the end of A Clash of Kings, with few major plot developments. When you figure that A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons are essentially one book, its hard to believe that so little could get accomplished in over 1500 pages. The characters are already developed, and they development little more. No one is moving anywhere, to fight or do anything. Out of three thousand pages, there are perhaps a half dozen major developments, and even those are somewhat minor in the big picture. Basically GRRM's last 1500 pages in this series equate to approximately half a novel worth of plot and character development. The other 1100 pages or so is just the characters acting in their continually cliche manners(cliche mostly in that we have read hundreds of pages about them, and they are already plenty well-developed)while going from point A to point B.",

            "British pop singer Dido returns after a five-year hiatus with her fourth studio album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Girl-Who-Got-Away/dp/B00BWGL6BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Girl Who Got Away</a>, released via RCA.  Girl Who Got Away follows up 2008s underperforming&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Safe-Trip-Home/dp/B001EO2UKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Safe Trip Home</a>, which was deemed favorable by many critics. Girl Who Got Away is a solid album for the most part, though not one that will likely one that will revitalize her previous commercial success or buy her new legions of fans.  \"Let Us Move On\" smartly brings in burgeoning rap darling Kendrick Lamar, but the chances of large exposure of the track seems unlikely.\n\n\"No Freedom\" seems concerned with the ambience, with Dido's vocals laden with reverb.  She sounds incredibly relaxed, which complements the folk-pop quality within the cut.  \"No Freedom\" is by no means an intense cut in itself, but the vocal arrangement and addition of instruments on the chorus add more body and intensity to the cut itself. \"Girl Who Got Away\" follows consistently, opening with cool, pulsating synths.  Dido's vocals are smooth (particularly her upper register), lacking the echoing reverb of the opener.  Simply on the chorus, Dido sings \"If only for today / I wanna be / the girl who got away / the lover who really loved / the dancer who danced / to the last song...\" The main rub with the title cut? Perhaps Dido comes off too relaxed and slightly lacking in personality.\n\n\"Let Us Move On\" finds Dido continuing in her casual, mysterious vocal approach, complemented by production to match the sentiment (Jeff Bhasker is onboard here).  Like the previous two cuts, this one is pleasant and Dido keeps things simple, particularly vocally on the chorus (\"Let us move on...for this is short / and it will pass\").  Kendrick Lamar drops a verse that matches the sentiment of both Dido and the cut itself.  It isn't the year's greatest triumph per say - it feels like it is missing something - but it is an enjoyable cut if not necessarily exceptional.\n\nOn \"Blackbird\", Dido continues to indulge into her refined vocals, if perhaps a bit much.  Listeners do get a clever lyric, intact with a staccato vocal execution: \"He put the coffee in the cup and with milk he filled it up / he added sugar and I never knew he liked it like that...\"  The production has some nice cues, though remains subdued. Songwriter/producer Greg Kurstin assists on \"End of The Night\", which takes a cool electro-pop approach, intact with driving synth and programming.  Dido's best moment is during the bridge in which she exploits her upper register (\"After the fall comes loves / I hat to hate and love to love\"). The results? Pretty good.\n\n\"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\" is one of Girl Who Got Away's strongest showings. Dido sounds beautiful, commanding, and never over-sings and the production matches her reservedness.  Backing vocals accentuate the lead during the second and successive iterations of the chorus.  The chorus itself is simple, but there is a beautiful innocence in its penning: \"There I was / sitting on the roof of the world  / there I was, there I was / Not knowing how I go there or how to leave...\" \"Love To Blame\" contrasts the simplicity of \"Sitting On The Roof\" with an interesting groove with a reggae undertone coupled with a pop/electro beat.  Dido's upper register continues to shine, particularly given her breathy vocal approach. Lyrically, she hits a high mark with lyrics \"She said I've dotted my I's and I've crossed my T's / had time for friends when they needed me...\"\n\"Go Dreaming\" makes one nod their head, given the percussive, driving beat with Europop flavor.  On \"Happy New Year\", Dido agains floats too casually, a detraction throughout Girl Who Got Away.  \"Loveless Hearts\" is more commanding than the latter, with Dido's vocals always commanding without necessarily being 'fiery' or forced.  Closing cut \"Day Before We Went To War\" is appropriately placed, but isn't quite as enjoyable as the beginning trio or the easygoing juggernaut \"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\".\n\nDoes Dido miss the mark? Nope, she sounds solid and for the most part&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Girl-Who-Got-Away/dp/B00BWGL6BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Girl Who Got Away</a>&nbsp;has more solid moments than ill advised ones. The main problem for Dido is that sometimes the productions are too cool and the vibe too restrained and unflustered. Usually, being 'flustered' might be a detraction, but a shakeup wouldn't kill Dido.  Not known as a vocalist for histrionics (nor is that expected of her), Girl Who Got Away could have been even better and made a bigger splash with some more risks.  But examining this set for what it is, it is solid.",

            "I bought the router for my RoadRunner cable modem.  The critical piece of advice was missing, however, which would otherwise have meant only a 10 minute set-up job.  When connecting as instructed in the manual, you also  have to call mediaOne/RoadRunner to give them the router MAC address.  Unfortunately they asked for the LAN MAC address of the router, which is  the wrong card.  You should give the WAN (Wide area) MAC number to the tech  people, who will add this to your list of MAC addresses.  This is at no  cost! Both MAC addresses are visible on the set-up screen of the router.  Once the correct WAN's MAC address was added to my account (and the modem  is powered down and rebooted), it worked like a charm.",

            "I purchased the Garmin GPS V in anticipation of two 3-day trips into areas I had never traveled.  The detailed maps that were supplied on the CD were excellent and accurate.  Before I left on the trips, I checked out the detail on the streets of Seattle, WA, because the many steep hills provide unusual angled streets with many turns.  The map followed them all and accurately named them.  I was impressed.  I was even more impressed when I traveled into the back country of the Olympic peninsula and, arriving at an intersection of two country roads, found that the GPS V maps named both of them correctly.  I'll never travel without it again.\n\nThe 19mb of memory is a bit too small to hold the number of maps that I regularly need and there is no additional memory card available to augment the capacity.  Erasing and downloading a new set of maps to the GPS from the computer is very easy and intuitive, but somewhat time consuming.  Adding even one detailed map to the GPS V required more than 30 minutes of download time, this in addition to any computer time selecting the maps to use.  Fortunately, the base map built into the GPS V good enough for the major interstate highways, exits, and services, so if you do not regularly travel to a number of large cities, the 19mb of memory may be ample for the detailed maps desired.\n\nThe dash mount supplied with the GPS V is excellent with locking angle adjustments and a quick-release.  It lacks only one very important feature: it must be mounted on a flat surface.  Try to find one of those on today's curved dashboards, and in a place where the antenna can acquire the satellites and you can see the display.  Fortunately, I was able to make an adapter plate that fit the dashboard and allowed the dash mount to be installed.  I am very pleased with the clarity of the display.\nThe instruction book that comes with the GPS V is very complete and leads step-by-step through the more complicated processes.  At the same time, the usual functions desired from a GPS are easy to set up and fairly intuitive by using the menu functions. The quick start guide is all most people will need to use the unit effectively.\nBattery life from 4 AA cells is sufficient if the backlight feature is not used too much.  Typically I found the batteries needed to be replaced after 18 to 20 hours.  The GPS V also comes with a cigarette lighter cable for powering the unit in the car.  A cable for hard wiring the GPS into the car's electrical system is available but not supplied.\nI especially like the option of \"on-road,\" which moves the cursor to the nearest road, or \"off-road,\" which will point your way to your destination or back home if you are hiking cross country.  Several pages of display will give you more information than ever thought possible: accurate local time, speed, distance traveled, average speed, latitude and longitude, elevation, time and distance to destination, and the best time for fishing (no kidding) just to name a few.\nThe auto-routing feature is a real help when traveling in unfamiliar areas, but I have found that sometimes it has made less than optimum routing suggestions when I tested it to destinations I knew.  Not a really big problem as it always directed me to the destination eventually.  One really great feature of auto-routing is that if you miss a turn or get off the suggested track, the GPS V immediately recalculates the route and displays turn-by-turn directions to the destination from where you presently heading.\nIn conclusion, I can say I am completely pleased with the Garmin GPS V and that it has many of the features of more expensive units.  I highly recommend it.",

Its usage is meant to help you as your planning a trip, as well as to give a short description of memorable experiences during your travel. I am someone who likes to write  A LOT, especially about my travels to remember every moment. At most you get half a page to a full page to note your travel experience, and notebook is not the largest, but travel size. Travel expeditions are further limited in the book to sections depending on the duration of your trip, whether, you had a weekend, short, or long trip. I felt it was limiting for me since I would rather write my experience for it's full duration instead of jumping all over the place. I really like the book because I love moleskine journals, it's leather feel of the cover, its compact size. However, if I knew the limitation I would have to put on writing my experiences in the travel journal, I don't know it I would purchase it again. Maybe it's for someone else.",

            "This Bernstein-led performance of Mahler's 2nd Symphony is undoubtedly the best reading of this piece that has ever been recorded.  This is probably the most accessible of Mahler's pieces, and it is also a great intro to his very unique style.  This symphony is just a fun roller coaster of colors and emotion, composed as only Mahler could.  Of course, no conductor understood Mahler quite like Bernstein did, so nobody could elicit more emotion and tension from Mahler's manic scores than ol' Lenny.  This recording is a perfect example of this.  Mahler's trademark explosive climaxes go off like an atomic bomb.  The music that leads to the climaxes is always long and drawn out in order to maximize the tension.  In the works of other composers, doing this may not be the best idea.  However, with Mahler, maximizing the tension and making the climaxes as explosive as possible is an integral part of expressing Mahler's manic emotions.  The sound is also excellent.  Though this was recorded live, you'd have no idea.  It really sounds like a studio recording with passion.  It's truly an essential CD and a must-have for any Mahler fan or interested casual listener alike.  Essential!",

            "Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando(I sadly have never played the first one, although I need to) is one of my favorite games of all time, so I found it amazing how much more I enjoyed the third entry in the series.  The new title continues to do what pt. 2(and no doubt pt. 1) exceled in: pure fun.  UYA features the same great platforming action with the RPG-style leveling up, and great variety.  There's huge battles throughout the planets you'll visit, and fun missions such as piloting a hovercraft to take out enemies from above, going through insane obstacle courses, and even the return of the sadly-all-too-brief Giant Clank.  The boss battles are humongous and really test the platforming skills.  The story is intelligent and humorous, and never fails to produce great laughs.  There's also excellent voice acting, including the returns of James Arnold Taylor(Final Fantasy X, Drawn Together), David Kaye(X-men Evolution, Inu-Yasha), and Jim Ward(Fairly Oddparents) as Ratchet, Clank, and Captain Qwark, respectively, as well as the great Micheal Bell.  Fans of the series, platformers, or gamers that just want a fun time, I really suggest buying this game if you don't already have it.  Believe me, it's worth it.",

I then poured my cup. Wow, it was mellow and good and strong without a hint of bitterness. Really smooth!\n\nThe instructions suggest moistening the basket before you put the ground coffee in it to keep the grounds from falling through, and this is a great tip.

            ".\nI really wanted to buy an iPod; I mean, to have the capability of carrying around thousands of selections in the palm of my hand! But then I realized there weren't thousands of songs I want to carry around, just hundreds. After all, every time I buy a CD, I'm lucky if there're more than a couple of songs I really want. Why would I want to spend time ripping, transferring, and storing songs I probably won't ever listen to? Anyway, I just couldn't get myself to spend many hundreds for an iPod.\nSo, I bought this little gem and it's perfect for my use. I've managed to put about 400 songs in WMA format (at 64kbps) on a 80 min (700MB) CD-R that sound just great and there's still some room to spare. They're all songs I want to hear. I also put a half dozen or so playlists on this CD, since this device handles up to 20 playlists. If I want more, I'll burn another CD-R with 400 more. It's no big deal to carry around a couple CDs with the player.\nThis device has flawlessly played audio CD's, CD-R's (70 & 80 min), and CD-RW's. I used both MP3 (at 128k) and WMA (at 32k and 64k to really save space).\nAt first, on reading the manual, I thought that I'd never remember all the combinations of the controls. You see, all of the buttons and jog controls serve 2 or 3 purposes depending on the mode you're in. But with actual use, I found they're not only very logically assigned, but that typically you'll setup configurations one time and rarely or never change them again. Things like backlight, contrast, settings for skip speed (fast forward/reverse speed) and many others are not things you'll change often if ever.\nI saw a criticism of this device that it lacks a bass boost - not true. Several play modes can be toggled, including an enhanced bass response; additionally, you can setup your own custom playback response called \"User Eq\" and crank up the bass just as far as you want.\nUpgrading the firmware couldn't be easier. Put the firmware update file onto a CD-R or CD-RW (I recommend CD-RW so it can be erased and reused afterward), load it into the machine, hit Play, it updates itself and switches off; just remove the disk and you're done.\nSound quality is first rate. Skipping has not been a problem. And although I didn't measure it precisely, battery life has been amazing. I played MP3's and WMA's for many hours on a set of pair of AA batteries, although I understand battery time with audio CDs is considerably less. The remote is very convenient and duplicates the thorough control of the main unit.\nI have only 1 criticism: The earbud phones supplied (I don't like earbuds anyway) are uneven in cord length; that is to say, there's maybe one foot of slack on the left phone and two feet on the right phone. This is supposedly to allow you to keep the connecting cord in the back of your neck, but it just drove me nuts; I used other phones which I like better, and would have anyway.\nThis is a GREAT device. I got what I want for my needs and for many hundreds less than the iPod over which I was drooling. I chose wisely.",

            "In 1984 U2 released their fourth studio album, titled \"The Unforgettable Fire\". It was a very important transitional record for them. Throwing themselves into the brilliant producing/engineering skills of Brian Eno and his associate Daniel Lanois, they managed to produce a more melodic, more coherent sound that U2 seemed to miss on their previous albums. They don't call Eno U2's fifth \"member\" for nothing.\nThis is one of those albums that will never die or be forgotten. It brought U2 the deserving attention of critics and fans alike. It features their best song they've written in the eighties (and one of the Edge's most recognizable guitar riffs), \"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\", a tribute to one man's courage and devotion for love and peace, the late Martin Luther King, Jr. \"The Unforgettable Fire\" and \"Bad\" displayed Bono's capability of writing lyric full of compassion and humanity, a thing that looks like he forgot how to do these days.\nAdam's bass playing is fantastic (listen to \"Wire\" and \"4th of July\" - U2's only instrumental track to date) and you'll get the picture. If you're only familiar with the work that U2 does today, the listen to \"The Unforgettable Fire\" and you'll be in for a surprise. This is rock played with such passion and intensity that couldn't be done by many other bands. A truly unforgettable album. It marked the end of their first period and gave promise of a stronger U2 in the future to come.",

            "This lip lacquer is not anything like your typical lip gloss.\nIt is richer and more pigmented than a gloss and the application is more precise and smooth with the included brush.\nAs for the texture, it goes on easily and dries to a soft, matte finish but not one that is too drying like many other long wearing lip products.\nWhat impressed me the most is the intensity of the color. I usually wear a similar shade lipstick under my gloss since most glosses fade so quickly. Not this one. This is the first lip gloss that I have used that can stand alone as far as color longevity.\nWhile it is not as intense as a traditional long wearing lipstick, the color does last and is perfect for a natural look that is still polished.\nThe 04 shade is a nice, soft pink that I imagine would work well for most skin complexions. FYI - The online photo of this shade appears to have a bit of brown in it but it does not.\nWhile I normally think luxury lip glosses are not worth the premium price, this is not your average lip gloss and is worth consideration.",

There, Ann meets Mordion, a \"death-faced\" magician and escaped Servant of the five evil Reigners who control the universe. Mordion uses his and Ann's blood to create Hume to defeat the Reigners. Ann and Mordion, though, quickly become fond of Hume and try to give him a normal life, with a robot, Yam, to watch over him. Suddenly, though, they find themselves involved in the intrigue of a castle filled with knights. Only after the Howl books, this is the best of Jones' insanely clever, beautiful fantasy novels. It is an enchanting, mind boggling, twisting, beautiful tale, with a charming love story at the center, and fantastic, fascinating, ambiguous characters (particularly Ann and Mordion). It's Douglas Adams meets King Arthur. Grade: A",

            "Years before Nirvana exploded, Springsteen wrote Darkness on the Edge of Town.  Years before Pearl Jam extolled Neil Young as the father of grundge,  Springsteen perfected the musical form.  This album lays out the format of  grundge in a desperate fury.\n It all started with a lawsuit and an  injunction that kept Springsteen from recording for three years.  While  Born To Run used a uniquely American garage-band sound to propel itself, it  also held true to the thematic played out rock opera of the period.  Born  To Run was Springsteen a bit confined to the time of the record.  Three  years later the walls of mainstream rock had collapsed with punk coming to  the forefront.  Springsteen takes advantage as the songs get shorter,  darker, and more driving.\n The injunction got to Bruce.  Three years off  had scarred him.  So much so that he wanted to explode, as he says in  \"The Promised Land\".  He sings of an America that has betrayed  him and hurt him throughout the album.  From lovers who hate for just being  born in Racing In the Street to a man who has fallen from society's graces  and blames his father in Adam Raised a Cain, Springsteen uses the grundge  theme of reaching for the most private thoughts and grabbing at the most  public issues.\n Every song is so strong and so heart-rendering that  Springsteen bares a bruising rhythm to keep from breaking down.  The  grittiness of his lyrics tell of men who've lost everything and the music  brings dignity to these characters.  Everything that Pearl Jam and Nirvana  were told that they had created, Springsteen had brought to life in 1978.  In his darkest time, he wrote an album that so perfectly described what he  was feeling, that it became ahead of ITS time and ahead of OUR time.\n As  the fading notes to Darkness play out, there is an undeniable hope in all  the characters Springsteen has presented and in every listener.  It's  undeniable.  Even though the man is still in the darkness, he's content  with what he has.  The perfect thought for the restlessness grundge would  dredge up in the nineties.",

            "*Note: I am on Chapter 8 as of 2/9/07 and these are my thoughts at this point*\n\nI had been looking forward to this game since it was announced (at E3 I believe).  I'm a huge fan of the Phoenix Wright series, so I thought this game was right up my alley.  However one thing concerned me... it was made by the same folks who did Trace Memory.\n\nI didn't like Trace Memory.  I thought the story was uninteresting (and I was disappointed and annoyed by the ending) and the whole presentation was very blandly executed.  Tap on a bookshelf and maybe there will be an item that you need and so on.  The only redeeming quality was some clever DS-feature puzzles.\n\nHotel Dusk is very similar to Trace Memory, but improved in most ways.  The story, although it starts out at an absolute crawl, is terrific.  It's kind of like the show Lost.  Every guest in the hotel has their own story that you go through (or pry outta them) and each story contributes to a greater underlying story.  And just about all the stories are interesting.  The mysteries will keep you tapping through.  And there will be one or more occasions where the stories are even heartwarming.  It's amazing how well you get to know these characters.\n\nYour character starts out as a complete jerk (and in a way stays that way), but in order to advance through the game and not get kicked out of the hotel, you have to make him more likable by choosing what he says.  Though it may seem at first that this game is tailored for young adult boys (it's got some mild profanity), I can see it being just as enjoyed by young girl casual gamers.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are not hard at all.  Some may throw you off for a bit, but a small amount of thinking and notetaking solves everything.  There are a few clever uses for the DS, but nothing really mindblowing. I'm glad that the puzzles are doable, but I kinda wish they were a little more challenging and rewarding.  There are many moments where you have to choose the correct thing to say (between 2 possible responses) in a row, otherwise the game is over.  This is pretty frustrating and the game overs happen often, so make sure to save a lot so you don't have to go through a lot of text dialogue again.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the quiz at the end of each chapter.  Trace Memory did the same and I find it really annoying that they need to reiterate the story.\n\nBut if you can stick through the first two chapters, you'll find a beautifully crafted game with excellent characters, stories and storytelling.  It's been a real pleasure walking in the shoes of the main character, Kyle Hyde.  And I'll be sad when it ends.  Hoping this will be a franchise. 4 1/2 stars",
            "This is an attractive little microphone with a very good sound.  The microphone sounds excellent on vocals (at least for my voice), and it does a great job recording guitars.  I have a bunch of microphones and I am definitely in love with this one and would put it up against my AKGC414 without hesitation.  The AKG has multiple patterns, so it is not an apples-to-apples comparison, but the Baby Bottle sounds better to me.  I like it so much that I bought another one that should be arriving in a few days.  The AKG was my go-to microphone until I tried this one.\n\nWhen comparing to the Blue Bluebird, the Baby Bottle is better for my vocals, as it doesn't have the bump in the top end.  The Bluebird is nice for a lot of things, but the Baby Bottle works better for me when recording vocals and guitars.  From what I have been told by others, some prefer the Bluebird because it is more forgiving and it has a bump in the high end, so keep this in mind too, as the Bluebird is $100 less.\n\nThe Blue Baby Bottle absolutely destroys my CAD Equitek E200.  The sensitivity is much better on the Blue, the sound has more character, and there is more warmth.  As with the AKG, the CAD is a multi-pattern microphone, so it is a different animal, but I greatly prefer the Blue.\n\nThe Blue is a lot better than the MXL V67G, but it is also a lot higher level of microphone.  I don't hate the MXL, by the way, but the Blue is in a different class.  If you can afford the extra money, get the Bluebird or the Baby Bottle over any of the MXL microphones in the lower range.\n\nThe Baby Bottle has a similar sound to the Blue e300 microphones I have, but it bests them easily.  To be fair, the e300 is a live and studio microphone, so it is far more versatile for people who want to use a microphone for live and recording.  The e300 is definitely a capable microphone, so I am not knocking it.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nThe Baby Bottle is VERY prone to pops from \"P\" sounds and the pop filter does not help.  In fact, the pop filter is not very useful at all and I would recommend buying a separate pop screen, or, if you are so inclined, you can make your own with panty hose and a needlepoint hoop.  I like to get a bit closer to the microphone in order to get a better capture of the low-end spectrum of my voice, but the pop screen with the Baby Bottle doesn't work well enough to allow this.  The shock mount is good, but, once again, the \"P\" sounds can cause a resonance in the shock mount if you are close to the mic.  I have simply ditched the Blue pop screen, good looking though it is, in favor of my old standby.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: 4.5 stars.  HIGHLY recommended.  Keep in mind that many people might be happier with the Bluebird for $100 less, as it has a brighter sound.  I prefer the warmer sound of the Baby Bottle, but your mileage may vary.",

I'd never record with it and usually don't even arrange full songs with it, but the ability to do A/B patterns, fills, and stop/start with foot switches allows me to extend or cut songs on the fly.\n\nThere's plenty of sounds and kits and options to tweak. If you can't make this sound good, you're not trying. I cut my teeth years ago with a Sequential Circuits Drumtrax and an Alesis HR16 and I don't find the SR18 difficult to use. You will probably need to read the manual and keep it handy for reference, but I can't imagine any modern drum machine being much easier to use.\n\nI haven't used the bass option, so I can't comment on it.

Mason always gets great feel out of his drums that really match the song.  Wright stays a little more in the background but still lays down some simply awesome keyboards.  But Gilmour, jeez, the lead work on this album is something not from this earth.\nPigs on the Wing 1 and 2 - Bookends to the 3 long songs.  Work great because they are so cut back and simple compared to the epics.\nDogs - One of the best songs ever.  One of the greatest guitar solos ever.

The pig sounds in the middle are great and the guitar solo at the end is so good it brings tears to the eyes.\nSheep - Probably the best known song off the album, though not my favorite.  Still the lyrics are awesome.

Because Duke Nukem has things you wouldn't expect to see in ordinary 3D Shooters.  With all the action you experiences the game has many humorous refference and to top it all off Duke Talk.\nI really don't recommend letting youngsters get there hands on this game as it is full of offensive materials and adult content, but if that stuff offends you don't worry the game has the feature to remove any adult content.\nThere is one downside.  With certain soundcards the game may crash under certain conditions, you can get a patch to repair this.\nThe game also features the build editor which allows you to create your own 3D worlds.",

            "Many have tried, but no one has ever been able to go toe to toe with Nintendo when it came to handheld gaming.  Nintendo's GameBoy has been dominating the market for over a decade now.  So in March 2005 Sony decided to try and take a slice of the handheld market with the PSP.  After owning one for 7 months, here's what I think of it.\n\nHARDWARE 4.5/5\n\nThe system itself is a beautiful piece of hardware.  The first time you watch a movie on it or play a game, you'll have a hard time believing that it's actually a handheld system.  The system is laid out almost like a PS2 controller, however it lacks a right analog stick and the two rear shoulder buttons (L2/R2).  Though the PSP doesn't quite have the power that Sony made it out to be (saying it's visuals would dwarf the PS2 itself), it looks as if it were a generation or two ahead of its rival the Nintendo DS.\n\nSOFTWARE 3/5\n\nThis has been the main topic of discussion about the PSP since its release.  The problem is that developers are making so many ports of PS2 games for the PSP rather than original titles.  This isn't completely bad but it makes many gamers think to themselves \"Why buy a stripped down version of Socom when I can just play it on PS2?\".  The first six months of the PSP's lifespan saw very few notable titles outside of Lumines and Untold Legends.  Recently things have started to pick up.  X-Men Legends II, GTA:  LCS, and Tales of Eternia (Import Only) have gotten me to play my PSP more often these days.  GTA was the PSP's first big hit game.  Whats really hurting the PSP is the lack of a true RPG title.  The current so called RPGs (Legend of Heroes, Popolocrois, Kingdom of Paradise), just seem far too generic and way too many flaws to make an impact.  Tales of Eternia has had me glued to my PSP for the past few days but that game is a European import.  A major RPG from Square/Enix would really give the PSP the spark that it needs.  All other developers would then follow suit.\n\nEXTRA FEATURES 4/5\n\nThe biggest extra feature of the PSP is its UMD movies.  How or why the movies sell so well is still a mystery to me.  They are usually more expensive than DVDs (a new release is usually $24.95), they can only be played on the PSP, and they don't include special features (even though I could care less about features anyway).  The movies do look amazing though.  It's like a plasma screen in the palm of your hand.  But even all of that isn't enough to make me want to buy lots of UMD movies.  The PSP is also capable of playing music.  Even with a 1GB Memory Stick I find it a bit impractical to use as a music player (I'll stick to my IPod).  It also stores photos and they look brilliant on the PSP.  The PSP can even hold full DVDs on its memory stick in the MPEG-4 format.  If you want to take advantage of this feature then I'd really recommend you get at least a 1GB Memory Stick because the 32MB one that Sony supplies is only good for game saves anyway.  The last great feature of the PSP is that it has the ability to store and play NES, SNES, Arcade, Genesis, GBA, and many other games on your PSP.  This is only possible if you have a version of the PSP that is 2.00 or older.  I won't tell you how to do it, just do a little research and you'll find out easy enough.\n\nAll in all I think the PSP is a pretty good handheld system.  I prefer it over the DS myself but that all depends on you.  The game lineup has been fair thus far but we need excellent.  It's far more powerful than the DS no question, but the PSX and PS2 proved that it's the software, not the hardware that makes a system successful.  With that I still have one question.  Square/Enix what are you waiting for?  The PSP needs you.",

Bohm brings out the details and intricacies like few other conductors. Of course, there are many other exceptional recordings of Mozart's symphonies, by such conductors as George Szell, Erich Kleiber, Bruno Walter, Josef Krips and so forth. Bottom line is this is an excellent set that is easily recommended, especially when compared to period performances. Another reviewer called this the worst Mozart recording ever. Huh!? I can understand liking other performances better than Bohm's, but that is one of the most laughably ridiculous statements I have ever had the misfortune to read. 4 1/2 stars.",

            "Unlike most people, I'd never seen this movie before until just recently and I watched it right after reading the book. So while I was watching it I kept comparing it with the book. I'll say this much: Silence of the Lambs is one of the best movies based on a book that I've ever seen. This is thanks in part to the exceptionally strong performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. Anthony Hopkins gives one of the most electrifying and mesmerizing performances I have ever seen in a movie. He's actually much different from the way I pictured Lecter when I was reading the book but Hopkin's acting in this movie is so chilling and malevolent that I don't mind the differences. Jodie Foster is just wonderful as Clarice Starling, she really captures Clarice's strength and vulnerbility. You can really relate to the character and her feelings. One thing that I liked a lot about this movie is that the conversations between Lecter and Clarice are mainly done in close ups, which gives these scenes an even greater intensity. Hopkins and Foster are of course the two most memorable performances in this movie but the other actors are also very good. Anthony Heald is excellent as the swarmy and annoying Dr. Chilton, Ted Levine (who's on the tv show Monk now) is extremely creepy and disgusting in his role as Jame Gumb, and Scott Glenn makes a good Jack Crawford. Although this is an excellent film, I still like the book better than the movie. There are alot of great things in the book that are missing in the movie, although the movie is a very close adaption. There is one thing however that was handled better in the movie than the book and that was Clarice's past. Clarice trying to save the lamb instead of her horse Hannah (which was in the book) seemed to work better with the storyline. This is an excellent movie but if you're one of the very few people out there who have never seen it before then I'd recommend that you should read the book first, because it's just fantastic.",

Compared to some of his later Drug and Anger fueled tales such as the Fear and Loathing tales and the Great Shark Hunt, Hell's Angels is Hunter in a more thoughtful journalistic mode.\n\nIn a time when the Angels were the terror of middle America and the mainstream press were regularly running tales of pack of thousands of bikers riding the road and entire towns being terrorized, Hunter was willing to do the hard yards to spend the time getting to know his subjects so that he could speak and write with authority. What he found was another pack of \"one percenters\" those guys who do not fit into society, who will always be the outsiders looking in amazed that we can live the life that we do.\n\nHunter also provides an interesting example of perception and reality and how one can  create the other, which is still highly relevant in our times. When the tales of the Angels first broke in the press, the reports spoke of thousands of Angels operating on the west coast, yet Hunter found the total active Angel population to be about 160. Yet after a year of sensational press coverage their were significant chapters of Angels across America driven largely by the prestige which the press the press endowed them with.",

Each card has 2 sides.  One side needs 1 letter; one side needs 2 letters.  (Thus far we've only used the 1 letter side.)  If a child can use one of the 2 letters he/she has to yell out the WORD!  I've had students grab the letter, yell out the letter, say the word wrong, etc...  However, that breaks the rules and the student doesn't get the letter.  :(  If the child does indeed make a word, the card is kept with the letter and the child gets a new card.  If letters aren't used they go back into the pile.\n\nIt takes time learning how to play this game.  My strugglers obviously needed more support than my non-strugglers.  The goal is/was to help students make words and recognize words and this game does exactly that.  It also helps them to differentiate between vowels and consonants, a skill that needs a lot of work.\nI have another game by the same manufacturer that has a word selector but for some reason it doesnt work.  This one, however, works like a charm!  I move the top of it and out pops two letters!  There have been no issues so far.  I say this in case you have the other game (Bingo Sight Word) and have had issues. (Good News!  I received the new one and its working perfectly.  Way to go!)  Rather than flipping cards using the machines makes the game more exciting.\nI highly recommend this game for anybody, parent or teacher, who is looking for additional help in the area of word work.  It helps with sounds, letter recognition, 3-letter words and so much more.\n\nNot so short.  Sweet.  To the point.",

            "I am sure a lot of players might disagree with this review but CTP 2 really has taken some steps in the right direction. If you liked CTP (1) game play interface then you will like this sequel.\nThe following are the major changes:\nCombat - A very important change is the addition of an armor attribute to each unit. This means that the phalanx will no longer be able to stand toe to toe with a tank - it simply won't be able to do much damage even if it hits.\nStealth - Spies will let you see all approaching hidden units. While you'll still need the appropriate defense team to stop the approaching stealth unit\nNew units, Wonders, and Advances CTP 2 includes the City Planner, an advanced settler option that allows users to build cities that come with basic buildings already included and that have a higher population. The game also has loads of new sea units.\nDiplomacy - This area is my favorite in the sequel. A completely new diplomatic model allows you to offer proposals and negotiate counter-proposals with other empires. React in friendly or hostile tones as you confront distinct opponents with more in-depth AI personalities for even more realism. Utilize all-new diplomatic options such as Borders to help define the geopolitical situation. For example, you could threaten to attack a country if they don't give you their maps.\nAdvances - The game will also include new Wonders of the World as well as new \"Feats of Wonder.\" These are one time, temporary bonuses that you get for performing certain actions. For example, if you're the first person to circumnavigate the globe, you get a sea movement bonus for a few turns.\nOther important changes in CTP2 are that the Space playing level has been completely removed and the game lasts from 4000BC to 2300AD (instead of 3000AD of CTP).\nOverall, what are you waiting for?! Go get it...\nAnjan",

I wondered how they got the live recording so fast with that arrangement, but my friend sitting next to me replied that I was crazy, because it also started that way on her vinyl copy.  I realized that those opening chords that fade in at the beginning are actually the end of a reprise of the Copeland theme, so I thought my tape was defective.

The missions are done well, and the intensity of a SWAT team is felt throughout each and every mission.  The controls, however, are a little bit jerky.  The aiming should be much more stable.  Your team is highly responsive, although not well defined.  For example, SOCOM's members have more personlity.  Additionally, they are not as bright  as SOCOM 2's team.  More choices during the briefing should also be included.  During briefing as well,  I wish they included a 3-D model map (so I don't go around in circles)  as in previous versions of Rainbow Six.  The inclusion of stealth missions were okay in theory, but were poor in final execution.  Who would send a SWAT member to place bugs on telephones and hack computers \"stealthily\"?  It is usually done by an undercover agents and their ilk.  Or at least not when terrorists are still INSIDE the building!

            "India has five thousand years of history that we have enough evidence to write about.  Any book that can simply be coherent and readable while covering so much ground is an achievement. John Keay's \"India: A History\" is more than that, though; it is superbly-written and powerfully narrated.\nKeay notes in the introduction that he has deliberately avoided focusing more on recent history than on ancient: \"a history which reserves half its narrative for the 19th and 20th centuries may seem more relevant, but it can scarcely do justice to India's extraordinary antiquity.\"  Naturally the availability of more historical sources does increase the attention paid to recent events, but still the Raj does not appear till nearly three quarters of the way through, and the 20th century and the real start of the struggle for independence is close to the end of the book.  The result is a long, thoughtful and detailed telling of many of the dynasties and civilization that flourished in India -- though, as Keay also says in the introduction, only the highlights are mentioned, since \"with perhaps 20 to 40 dynasties co-existing within the subcontinent at any one time, it would be [. . .] sado-masochism [to include them all]\".  So even at this extra level of detail there has been substantial editing.  And there could have been more; the book's only fault is that Keay mentions just too many of the endless dynastic dramas.  The essence of a one-volume history is selective editing, and the book could have been shorter and a little less dry in places.\nHowever, the picture of India that emerges is deep, complex and fascinating, from the earliest Harappan archaeological relics through to the Gandhis.  The Raj is of course particularly interesting: although technologically and industrially the British clearly surpassed them greatly at the time of the Raj, some of the diplomatic exchanges that Keay retails show the Indians as being more sophisticated, more civilized, and in many ways just smarter than the British.  It was inevitable that the yoke would be thrown off; the only question was what India would be able to do with its independence.\nKeay's prose is also a great pleasure; he has a wonderfully dry sense of humour, and he conveys exciting events with panache but also with precision and clarity.\nRecommended.",

            "This album was released after Cream broke up.  It is an amazing collection of 4 live tunes ranging from 6 to 15 minutes long.  This is power trio jamming at its best.  It is an excellent fusion of jazz, blues and mostly rock. While there is alot of Eric Clapton and his guitar solos, there is much intriguing interplay with Ginger Baker on drums and Jack Bruce on bass and harmonica.  Overall, it is much more complex and energetic than the live material on Wheels of Fire, and far superior to the follow up Live Cream II.\nThe fifth song, Lawdy Mama is a short, interesting studio artifact  It is Cream's version of a traditional blues tune that eventually evolved into Sunshine of Your Love.\nIf you like Cream, the best bet is to get the box set Those Were the Days.  It includes all 6 Cream albums plus other unreleased material.",

But what makes this version of the album better than all the rest?  Well for starters the sound quality is very well remastered for an excellent sound given what must be the state of the original master tapes.  Also, the mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design is a real treat for fans as it is made from good quality cardboard and very faithfully recreates the original lp design.  Included is a 28-page booklet that has a very good essay on the album by producer Gus Dudgeon as well as all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  This is certainly the definitive version of the album that is currently out there.  Highly recommended!",

The guitar work will please everyone and the chorus sounds great here. Prime 80's metal!\n\n6. Armed and Dangerous(10/10)Best song on the album.i love the lyrics and the guitar riffs are suberb. With music like this the 80's sound has got to come back! Just listen to that guitar solo in the middle!\n\n7. Rhythm or Not(7/10)Decenet rocker.\n\n8. Bodily Harm(7/10)keeps the pace moving.\n\n9. Eyes of a Stranger(8/10)The intro riff is killer. A good song!\n\n10. I'll cry for You(9/10)Dam good instrumental track.\n\nFans of the 80's will want this album. This is an overlooked piece of good 80's metal! Also I recommend buying every Y&T album that was made before this one.

Lenny continues to give you rock anthems and a couple songs that seem as though written from his personal diary (Papa).I like Lenny b/c he seems to try to write rock n' roll music and  doesn't leave his comfort zone.  Most of the album is driven by funky guitar rifts and simple (but they are good)lyrics, and actually he plays the guitar more freely on this cd than any of his others.  This cd isn't as personal as Baptized was (which had me thinking Lenny was suicidal;Baptized I think was lyrically his most honest/personal cd) but it is more of like a solid effort of good fast songs, good funk music, good slow songs.  Lenny is to me a master at making beats. He isn't one of the greatest on the guitar and he really can't sing (although he sounds better with every album)compared to great singers but when it comes to a beat that makes you move your feet and feel like you can't stand still; he is like Pharrell Williams and this cd proves pure rock n' roll; not Heavy Metal; rock n' roll.",

            "Ok, this entire review is about the potential for stringing these up on traditional 4 ply yarn for either therapeutic purposes for the developmentally delayed or traditional early toddler activities.  As a food item, they've got enough sugar and refined flours in them that they are more or less going to act like candy in your kiddos' systems, and if you were to ask the nutritionally puritanical side of my nature the only thing I could say about them is that they are vitamin enriched sugar bombs.\n\nI was actually super excited when I saw these, because I had gone into our local grocery store a few weeks ago looking for cheerios or gluten free fruit loops so that I could work on stringing them with our son, who has a whole bunch of things going on with him diagnosis wise and has global developmental delays because of it.  He also has very little impulse control and no risk assessment, so I needed something we could improve his fine motor skill with that wouldn't need to be surgically removed if he ate and swallowed some of them.  All I could find were the very berry Cheerios, which don't look quite so colorful, actually have slightly more sugar, and have a smaller opening, small enough that traditional 4 ply yarn wouldn't fit well through them.  So I had to use doily thread for the attempt to string them, I honestly wasn't sure if my little man would be able to do it.  I was happier then I could say when he succeeded, but I wanted to see how he would do with these given the different colors (because sometimes that matters with him and I wanted to see if he'd treat the process the same way), and I was hoping they'd have a wider hole.\n\nThey do, and most of them are wide enough to fit on traditional yarn.  Now he did try to eat a couple, but decided he didn't like the mixture of flavors in his mouth and wouldn't eat any more of them after that.  He's very particular that way...never the flavors shall mix, that sort of thing.

To me this is a heady mix of rose and vanilla and amber -it lasts for ages and ages and the rose doesn't smell dusty or old. (Yes, I know rose can scare some people). It also has notes of magnolia but really, what you smell are rose, vanilla and amber. I read the composition and maybe there are other green scents-I've read Lily of the valley mentioned-but I don't smell it.\nI was impressed by the HUGE lasting power of this EDT. It's the kind of scent when someone snuggles your neck you smell good-it doens't shout in an elevator. The kind that's unique enough that when your ex smells it again you're all they can think of (or the reverse!)\nWhat I find amusing is that I had bottles of Calypso Amber and Calypso Rose and had  been creating something similar for myself by mixing those two before I found Tocade.\nI'm not an evening or day scent person-as I said this scent whispers and doesn't shout but some people prefer vanilla/amber for evening scents. It seems more a Fall/Winter/Spring scent than a summer scent. But really, it's such a personal scent that I think it transcends time or season specific use.\n\nThe scent was created my Maurice Roucel -DKNY Be Delicious, Gucci Envy, Lolita Lempika and some Bond No9 and Frederic Malle scents are also his creations.",

            "Deadly Partnership hooked me with the first chapter. Who was the mysterious killer? Roland was a smug SOB, but what did he do to deserve being buried alive? Did poor Wendy survive? How did this all tie in with Paul? The only question not answered concerned Wendy, but considering Paul wasn't totally unscrupulous I suppose she was safe after she did what he asked. Other than his wife dying, Paul Jenkins seemingly had a perfect life up till his retirement. Even his plans to move in with his sister Julie in their childhood home in the place they grew up seemed set to be a bed of roses. He forgot about the thorns. Everything went perfectly -- reconnecting with his sister, son, old friends, old flame, remodeling the house -- until the night a burglar broke in. Death intrudes several times, or should I say gets invited in? Julie's away on vacation, so she has no idea what nefarious schemes her brother carried out until she comes home and gets a ghost of an idea. There were times I almost despised Paul, but in the end he did prove that he could still put a few other people before himself. Richard Gardner found me on Goodreads and offered me a chance to read a PDF of his book for a review because he saw that paranormal was one of my favorite genres. How he found me among countless members is beyond me, but I'm very glad he did. I enjoyed reading Deadly Partnership very much and look forward to reading more by him.",

            "A Good game comes along, entertaining millions of fans worldwide. Then, a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place. Ever since the beginning of game history, every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year. Since Sept. 98, that cycle has been broken, stopped by one game that never got replaced, even by it's sequals, nothing ever ended out better than Zelda: Ovarina of Time. This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system. It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline. It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it. This game, I am predicting, will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out (The one after gamecube). Its Z-Targeting system makes Link (the main character) look at an enemy, within this looking, he can circle around it in stategic patterns, accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away, and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks. Many games, even nowadays, imitate this system, but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does. The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it. All these children have one compainon fairy with them, except one boy, who does not. Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time, you know your in for an adventurous, complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month. And, this game has many, many side quests to do. There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with, 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas, 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with, 15 masks to sell and play around with, 6 empty bottles to collect, a chicken to rais, and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game. And much more. This game also has the perfect sound to it. The cheerfull, happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it's background music. The adventurous, wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it's background song. The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it's song. Everywhere you turn in this game, you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place, and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place. This game's sequal, Majoras Mask, suffered horribly from the lack of this. And the prevous games in the series didn't meet this either. One more thing though, I'll admit it to the world, I hate the main Zelda theme. I'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time, In a game that so clearly stands out with it's music, one old sounding, bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time. Oh, I forot to mention that part too, the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it. The places are designed very well, and when mixed in with the fabulous background music, gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game, whatsoever. The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest, which actually used to seem so big, onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild, the sun will blind the screen for a moment, and as rising, reveal this spectacular, wide open feild with a tuft of trees, a monstor here and there, a ranch in the middle, and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun. Along the feild, a rise in elevation starts, as you climb the hill, you can see even more than you could before, a magestic, huge catsle, a winding clear blue river, a deep valley, a menancing volcanoe, and a huge lake, along with a tuft of trees, and a monstor here and there. As you travel to new places, you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too, when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small, humble houses of the village below it, with the perfect backgrond music for example. With this great feeling of adventure, huge enviroments, much huger than even the ones of nowaday games, and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time, until a greater game will come out, wich will probably take a very very long time. If you don't already own this game (Shame on you), you should buy it immediatly, and while waiting for it to ship, download an emulated version. Now. Or else.",

            "Initially a hit arcade game, then a Dreamcast exclusive, Crazy Taxi has been one of Sega's most popular new franchises, a reason to buy a DC in and of itself.  Once Sega began spreading its talents to other consoles, CT was one of the first games to be exported, to both PlayStation 2 and GameCube ... but not XBox.  Instead, Sega and Hitmaker have brought an all-new version of the game exclusively to Microsoft's big black console.  It retains everything that made the original (and its DC-only sequel Crazy Taxi 2) great, while bringing with it new features and, unfortunately, a couple of new flaws.\nIf you've been living incommunicado lately (say, the last 2 1/2 years), the game casts you as a taxi driver in a big city, in this case Glitter Oasis (an homage to Las Vegas).  You get to choose one of four personas, each with uniquely-styled cabs (the choice of cabbie doesn't really affect gameplay enough, so just choose one you like).  Your job is to pick up passengers and transport them to their destinations within a certain time, using any means necessary.\nPotential fares are highlighted by a colored dollar sign over a similarly-colored pick-up zone.  Red symbols denote short-distance (i.e., cheap) fares, with yellow, green and blue symbols pointing the way to more challenging (and more rewarding) fares.  An arrow at the top of the screen directs you towards your destination, a large highlighted area where you stop and drop-off your passenger.\nIf you make things \"interesting\" along the way, by executing high-speed drifts, near misses or gravity-defying jumps, your passenger will tip you more and more.  Succeed, and you get the fare plus the tips, along with bonus time to pick up other riders ... fail, and the passenger stiffs you and hops out of the cab, even if the destination is in sight.\nFans who missed out on CT 2 will notice a new feature ... the ability to pick up multiple passengers.  These riders are highlighted by a number instead of a dollar sign.  The stakes get really high here, since (a) your travel time--and potential fare--is much higher and (b) tips are multiplied by the number of passengers you have.  However, this is an all-or-nothing proposition ... if even one of the group doesn't make their destination in time, you lose the *ENTIRE* fare.\nCT 3 is one of the most replay-loaded games released in a long time.  Crazy X brings you several new mini-games to play and unlock, along with a chance to improve your skills.  Best of all, you get West Coast and Small Apple, the arcade maps (modeled after San Francisco and New York, respectively) from both Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2, along with their own unique cabbies!\nAs cool as all this sounds, it's not without its flaws, minor as they are.  The game can be slow-loading at times, although it is faster than the demo disc some of you may have seen.  While graphically gorgeous, it's not significantly better than even the Dreamcast versions of CT and CT 2.  In fact, there are points of some limited slowdown; however, the screen has to be quite busy for this to occur, and when it does occur it isn't for very long (a couple of seconds).\nThe in-game music is appropriately fast-paced and very hard-rock oriented, from arists like The Offspring, Bad Religion and Tommy Lee.  It retains tracks from both previous games, and even re-uses sound samples.  Hardly original, but it don't take that much away from the game.  (Parents please note: Some of the music tracks have some brief adult language, hence the game's T rating.)\nIf you're a fan of CT and CT 2, you really can't go wrong with CT 3, especially since you get to re-live those games once again.  If this will be your first foray into the world of Crazy Taxi, rest assured that the positives of the game far outweigh the negatives.  Now get out there and make some crazy money!",

            "This game....THIS GAME!!!! I simply adore this game. Its my favorite fighting game of all time and one of my top 10 favorite games period. To me, everything comes together seamlessly to make a brilliant, approachable yet hard to master, beautiful fighting experience that has yet to be topped for me. This game has so much content, attention to detail, wonderful characters with most of them having their own unique fighting style (I will admit there are some copies of characters here) and character traits that they show in battle! My favorite is Yoshimitsu, since he is a great example of showing character while fighting and his backstory and goals are just so awesome, but that is a whole other speal. This game gives you a lot of replay value even when you are just playing by yourself: Weapon Master where you complete levels and unlock a huge amount of weapons, Practice Mode, Arcade Mode (your general arcade mode), VS. Mode, Team Battle, Survival Mode, Time Attack, and not to mention new costumes for some characters when you go along Weapon Master, full character logs when you complete arcade mode with their respective characters which include their lore, character design, phrases said in battle, and even their respective stages. Top it off with an excellent combat system that is fun for everyone yet hard to master, 3 characters based on each version of this game (Link for the Gamecube Version, Heiachi from Tekken for the PS2 version, and Spawn for the Xbox version since Todd Mcfarlane handled some of the characters art direction and even created one by the name of Necrid), then you got what is in my opinion the complete fighting game package. This game hasn't died on me either, I STILL play this game with my friends whenever I get the chance to. One last thing, all three versions are great, I grew up playing the PS2 version then when I got a Wii I transitioned to the GameCube version, take it from my experience, if you have a GameCube, the GameCube version is definately the best port of the game other than the newly released HD Online (which I still haven't played yet), out of the three, I think the GameCube version has the smoothest framerate and the best of the three guest characters. I know I typed an essays worth about this game, but you really should buy this game on whatever version you can manage.",

No se por qué, pero esa entrada en el campo de concentración nunca había pasado por mi retina. Además esta vez me he enterado que está basada en un hecho real, con los que los pelos como escarpias habituales se han convertido en pelos como vigas de rascacielos. Que maravilla de película.La película trata sobre un moderno campo de concentración durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. En él caen todos los presos militares que han sido capturados y recapturados muchas veces, o sea, experetos en fugas. Según la filosofía del jefe al mando, han metido a todas las manzanas podridas en un cesto. Así que los presos deciden, guiados por un lider natural, hacer la mayor fuga que nunca se hizo, para lograr que las tropas nazis pierdan el tiempo en buscarles, en vez de luchar en el frente.Esta película es de las pocas de la Segunda Guerra mundial en la que no se muestran crueldades, ni horrores de guerra ni de los campos de concentración. Se nos muestra una cara muy amable de la Guerra, con unos nazis muy inocentes, que rozan la candidez absoluta. Por el otro lado, los aliados son astutos e inteligentes en su mayoría, con un gran sentido del honor y del deber. Quizá demasiada cándida la visión que da, pero desde luego una película tremenda. Un reparto buenísimo, con una historia real que pone los pelos de punta y llama a la épica, logra mantener una tensión durante casi tres horas, cosa nada fácil de hacer.Resumiendo, imprescindible película semi bélica, que nos muestra la mayor fuga de presos que tuvo lugar durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial.

            "The Mophie Juice Pack Air may be just what you need if you're running into challenges with iPhone battery life, and don't want to (or can't) be tethered to a power cord. In my experience it does just about double battery life, and it seems solidly made.\n\nThe Juice Pack Air is a two-piece case. The iPhone slides into the bottom piece, which has the standard iPhone jack on the bottom. The top piece then slides over the top of the phone. It's a solid, snug fit. There's no face built into the case, so use a screen protector for maximum protection. The iPhone synchronizes and charges via a provided cable that connects to a USB port.\n\nIn terms of functionality, the Juice Pack Air has two modes, selected by a small slider switch on the bottom of the case.\n\nMode 1: The Juice Pack Air is constantly charging your iPhone until the Juice Pack's battery is depleted, after which the iPhones internal battery is used. Using this mode, you can use up the Juice Pack Air's battery, remove the case, and continue on with just the iPhone.\n\nMode 2: The iPhone's battery is used first, with the Juice Pack's battery on reserve. When the iPhone is battery is depleted, you flip the switch on the bottom of the Juice Pack to begin powering/charging your iPhone from the Juice Pack. Using this mode, you can keep the case charging on your desk while you use the phone, then slide the phone into the case to increase your battery life. It's almost like being able to swap in a new battery. The Mophie documentation suggests that this second mode maximizes battery life.\n\nThe Juice Pack Air does add some size and weight to the iPhone. I measured and weighed the phone with and without the case, with the following results:\n\nWithout Juice Pack/With Juice Pack\nThickness: 12mm/19mm (0.47inch/0.75inch)\nWidth: 62mm/66mm (2.44inch/2.60inch)\nHeight: 115mm/125mm (4.53inch/4.92inch)\nWeight: 138g/204g (4.9oz/7.2oz)\n\nFinally, some design details. The Juice Pack Air has four LED's on the back of the case, which allow you to check the case's battery status at the press of a button. The case itself is shiny and polished, so it looks nice but it really shows fingerprints, etc. If you have large fingers, you may find it difficult to operate the volume and mute buttons with the case installed. Finally, the charging connector for the Juice Pack Air appears to be proprietary (although it resembles a standard USB connector, it's not). If you have an existing charger (such as for a car) that uses the iPhone connector, it will not work with the Juice Pack Air installed. Mophie offers a car charger separately.",

            "I bought the Nokia N8 for my mom for Christmas because it had all the things she wanted (touch screen phone, smart phone, mp3 player, and to combine devices such as her excellent camera). Alas, she didn't want it (likes her simple flip better, easier to hold, and she doesn't like touch screen for a phone, just for an mp3 player)\n\nBut ....\n\nI DIG it. It is smaller than the E7, which is a beast in comparison. Camera is amazing, flash blinding.\n\nOther awesome factors:\n! HDMI out\n! USB on the go\nFM transmitter - so simple, but so so convenient\nstorage <- 16gb built in + 32gb on microsd = 48gb (plus usb)\n\nData access is very controllable. Maps can update via sms (or network, or simple unassisted GPS). You can set priority of data access to favor wifi, or whatever priority for many access points (wifi, 3g, network, etc). Manage data. Cool. I say, get this phone, and go for a cheap GSM plan.\n\nNotes:\n1. came with Symbian^3, but not Anna. Anna makes the difference. If Anna hadn't updated, I would definitely have returned it. Lusting for Belle.\n2. camera protector - it ships with a camera protector for shipping. Remove this thing or your photos will be super hazy.\n\nGet these apps:\nNokia apps: Situations, Panorama, PlayTo, Here and Now, Big Screen, Reader (but, don't subscribe to too much it will drive you crazy if a widget), Map, Drive, Places (pretty cool)\nNoka beta apps: Live View (frikkin awesome)\n3rd party, best: Fring (forward facing camera, google voice integration, etc, second favorite 3rd party), Opera Mini or Mobile (favorite 3rd party app), Wordpress\n3rd party, non-Ovi: Books (from Meego project, not sure who the developer is)\n\nIt's kind of slippery. I think anyone who gets it will have to get some kind of protector case.\n\nDrat:\n1) I haven't found a way to turn on the camera flash as a flashlight like my E7 (and pretty much all my other old Nokes handsets would) will do (hold screen lock for like 5 sec till it comes on/off)\n2) no Kindle app\n3) no Netflix of Hulu\n4) no Meego :( why Nokia why? so sad (tho Anna is good)\n\nBELLE UPDATE;\nBelle is very pretty. It seems to improve performance (speed). Books (which I previously got from Meego site) now appears in the updated Nokia Store. Nokia Live View (beta app) is now Nokia City Scape.\n\nUPDATE (2012-0610):\nStill love the phone after 6 mo.\nWhy? Several reasons.\nAmazing camera.\nLots of photo & music/sound editing capability onboard (with each Symbian version), gps voice navigation the same quality as a stand alone unit (this alone makes it worth the purchase), FM extras (radio and radio out). Also, the autocorrect/predictive text is better than my ipod touch, by several orders of magnitude, which really surprises me. Also like the large onboard and very large expandable memory. And HDMI out. And built in backup options.\nPerpetual annoyances: not Meego (so sad so sad), no Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video, no Kindle app. There are ways to Get Around each of these annoyances, but, well, if it had Meego there would be no need. Hoping Nokia/Accenture merges Meego with the goodies of the other open source platforms (WebOS & Meego/Tizen) and resurrects in house OS. But not holding my breath on that one. Also, strangely, the phone likes to spontaneously reboot; is this due to my carrier (TMo)? full phone memory? What's that about? I have the feeling it may be carrier related, but again, no bets there.\nI've got a family plan, with an ancient data plan which is very cheap. And in this case, there are very few options out there with better value (than using this unlocked user-controlled phone).",

But the Blues Project (they took the name of an  earlier Elektra sampler on which three had played) at their best had their  own substance and ethic. \"Live at Cafe Au Go Go\" was the best of  their original albums; \"Projections\" the best of their studio  work. (\"Planned Obsolescence,\" billed as the fourth Blues Project  album, was actually the test flight of what became Seatrain -  bassist/flutist Andy Kulberg had assembled a new band to fill out their  Verve Forecast contract and threw forth a new style, a hybrid of folk,  rock, and jazz completely distinct from the Project's style. For that  matter, Seatrain themselves deserve a hearing today.) Though plagued by  musical indecision and personality conflicts in the end, at their best the  Blues Project - particularly guitarist Danny Kalb, keyboard ace Al Kooper,  and Kulberg - lived up to their legend. And for the most part you get their  best here, though \"Live at Cafe Au Go Go\" deserves a complete,  remastered reissue.",

The metal clip will scratch up the cover of some books if you're worried about that. I prefer strength and quality over a few scratches on a paperback. The only issue is the power switch is small and not held in place very well. It has fallen off a couple of times. It easily pops back into place and the light is still useable without the button, but sooner or later the button is going to go missing and I'll be left turning the thing on and off with a dime.",
            "Dealer was a bit shady on the details, it was somewhat marred. Someone tried to force it on with a wrench, but that's irrelevant in this review. The Filter went on for me with no troubles at all. I've had good luck with my Brita's and this was the easiest of last 3 to get on. The filter was the same as my old twist turn one. I bought this one because the twist turn ones tend to snap, so figured I would try my luck. This is my 3rd one in 4 years. Them twist turn knobs do bust. They jam and then snap. The sliding mechanism on this one was clearly superior. Very well done, with noticeable incremental stop points,  and well, its  just pretty great! I was amazed. It is solid and not flimsy unlike the twist turn knob one like this. The filters are identical on the two models. U get 100 gallons. Ignore the change every 4 months. U can go safely up to 6 months. Only use cool water through the filter. U'll kill the filter if you use hot, trust me. The LED light on mine doesn't work but I bought it used, so I expected something not right with it. But I'm sure it worked at one time. That's ok too since I count my usage manually. All in all, this is the Brita on the Tap to buy. After having 2 others (the twist knob types) I can definitely say this is the one to buy.",

It could be the excellent acting, it could be the complex storyline, and it could be  the wonderful direction.  I can't decide.  I will warn you that if you do  not watch it with an open mind, you will hate it.  It is basically about a  family man who falls for one of his daughter's beautiful friends, which  eventually leads to his mid-life crisis, and ultimately his death.  I feel  comfortable telling you he dies because in the first ten minutes of the  film he tells you that he is going to (he is the narrator the entire time).

            "I've tried a lot of serums in the past year.  I'd say this one measures up to most, if not all, of them.  I don't have a huge problem with fine lines yet, but the idea is to start using anti-aging products now (in my mid/late 30s) to prevent issues in the future.\n\nI love that this has hyaluronic acid from a vegetarian/plant source, and I'm super glad it says so on the label.  Most hyaluronic acid is a byproduct of poultry processing so I'm very happy to see a non-animal source in a product.  And I would argue that the vegetable hyaluronic acid in this product works as well as any other.  I felt an almost immediate (but not unpleasant) tightening of my skin when I used this.  In general, hyaluronic acid hangs on to a lot of moisture -- that's what generates the plumping and wrinkle filling effects.  I used a moisturizer after this, but I probably didn't need to!\n\nI found this to be moisturizing but also to be suitable to use under makeup.  I tried it in the morning and my makeup performed as expected.  (I've recently had an experience with a different product where this was not the case, so I definitely think it's worth mentioning!)  This means that this serum could be used both morning and evening, if you prefer.\n\nPlease note that this contains willow bark extract, so it has some salicylic acid in it.  Keep this in mind if you are allergic or sensitive to aspirin.  Salicylic acid is wonderful (for me, at least) for clearing up blemishes and breakouts and I feel this product helped with that.  You will probably want to wear sunscreen if using this product because of the willow bark extract; this serum does also contain some antioxidants which will help with sun damage (for example, from the black tea leaf extract and grape juice).\n\nThis has a nice texture and smell with no artificial fragrances or dyes.  The large number of plant extracts should be suitable for sensitive skin, although consider doing a patch test first, as always, if you are concerned.  I, personally, didn't have any issues.\n\nI like the texture and thought this applied smoothly and without leaving a residue, though it did take a moment or two to fully dry.  You don't need a whole lot to get full coverage of your face and neck, either, so one bottle should last a long time.\n\nBelow are the ingredients since they don't appear on the product page.\n\nIngredients: Organic apple juice, organic white grape juice, organic aloe juice, organic lemon juice, vegetable glycerin, polysorbate-20, sclerotium gum, capryl hydroxamic acid, caprylyl glycol, saccharum officinarum (sugar cane), hesperidin methyl chalcone (Vitamin P), steareth-20, dipeptide-2, palmitoyl tetrapeptide-3, xanthan gum, lysolecithin, pullulan, organic evening primrose oil, organic linseed oil, organic borage seed oil, mandarin peel oil, willow bark extract, lemon extract, black tea leaf extract, organic sugar cane extract, algae extract, ubiquinone (CoQ10), dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), thiotic acid (alpha lipoic acid), vegetable hyaluronic acid, tocopherol (Vitamin E), retinyl palmitate (Vitamin A), magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (Vitamin C), tetrasodium glutamate diacetate, sodium hydroxide, sweet neroli, organic may chang, and cinnamomum camphora pure essential oils.",

            "I remember buying this CD the day it came out.  Her first CD was already a classic so I expected the same from her sophomore release.  On her first CD, Toni had a combination of slow songs, midtempo grooves, and uptempo grooves.  After hearing the single, \"You're Makin' Me High\" I  expected the album to be more of the same just like her first CD.  After  the CD was over, I was impressed by the way Toni Braxton presented  different tales of slow jams.  On \"Secrets\" Toni Braxton had a  lot more producers than she did on the first CD.  Babyface and L.A. Reid  did most of the work on the first CD, but on \"Secrets\" there's  more of a variety, which doesn't hurt the CD at all.  Babyface, this time  around is actually working by himself, without his business partner L.A.  Reid.  The best examples of Toni's slow jam presentation are \"There's  No Me Without You\" which is produced by Babyface, \"Talking in his  Sleep\", \"I Don't Want To\", and \"Un-Break My  Heart\".  This is a great CD for anyone that likes slow jams or  ballads.  If you are a fan of more uptempo and midtempo songs this might  not be the CD for you.  Her first CD might be a better recommendation.",

            "If you've played Wii Sports and are expecting Wii Play to be more of the same fun, think again.  Wii Play's games are much less involved, and while there are 9 games overall, there aren't any hidden games or fun features that made Wii Sports so enjoyable, just mindless medals you can collect as you pursue high scores (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum).\n\nWhile Wii Sports was a game in which you could unlock features as you progressed, the only thing you unlock in Wii Play are the 9 games, and you're forced to do this unlocking process when you begin.  Instead of being able to play all the games, you start with one, have to play it, then you can play the next one, until you end up in the ninth and final game.  What is really annoying about this is that your score during the first run does not count toward the medals you get, so don't worry about doing well in any game until you have them all unlocked.  Also, once you get a gold medal, you have to play again to even have a chance to get a \"platinum\" medal.\n\nEvery time you get a medal your Wii gives you a hint about the game.  However, if you get a Silver or Gold medal before you get a Bronze for example, then you lose out on a tip.  Very poor design if you ask me.\n\nOf the nine games, I found Shooting Range, Charge!, Tanks!, Billiards, and Fishing rather fun, but Find Mii, Table Tennis, Pose Mii and Laser Hockey are not that great.  Five decent side-games for $10 isn't too bad though.\n\nThe Enjoyable\n01. Billiards -- There is a bit of a learning curve here and it's awkward because there doesn't seem to be any penalty for sinking the wrong balls, but with time you'll love it.  Just find some music to play because this game has a terrible soundtrack.\n\n02. Tanks -- While Tanks! is by far the most complex game on the disc, it is also annoying to have to start from scratch all the time.  Nice freeform play though and there is no time limit for single player mode.  Pretty addictive.\n\n03. Charge! -- While there is only one course, riding a weird looking cow is pretty cool.  Unlike the other games, you decide where you are going the whole time, and the freeform design, despite the time limit, is a lot of fun.\n\n04. Shooting Range -- This game will make you want a Wii Gun, lots of fun but limited playback.  Just fun to shoot targets with Wiimote.\n\n05. Fishing -- Very limited hungry hungry hippo like game, casting can be awkward due to the fish running out of room to swim, but an interesting game.  The graphics are odd though.\n\nThe Boring\n06. Find Mii -- There are some interesting scenes, but very easy to get bored.  Great for puzzle seekers and memory building though.  For the \"odd Miis out,\" just look for something like Miis looking the wrong way at tennis.\n\n07. Pose Mii -- Once again, great for the puzzle-loving crowd, but not my style of fun.\n\n08. Table Tennis -- All you do is move the remote back and forth like pong, no swing, no skill involved except twitch gaming.  Much better for the Wiimote actually than Laser Hockey since you move left and right rather than up and down the whole time, but still rather boring after awhile.  I mean, if you have Wii Sports, Tennis is just so much better than Table Tennis.\n\n09. Laser Hockey -- Worthless to play in single player, you'll end up watching the CPU score goals for you because the \"puck\" ends up weirdly getting past the paddle too easy and it becomes impossible to save.  You'll do the same back sometimes for the CPU.  Better in multiplayer but the game dynamics just suck.  It's hard to play a game with the Wiimote when you are controlling the left or right side of the screen and the game would have probably been more fun to use with traditional controller rather than a Wiimote.",

            "Either I'm working way too much, sleep deprived, or genetics dictate that I am destined to have tired bags and wrinkles around my eyes.  NUXE Anti-Fatigue Eye Cream is absolutely fantastic at moisturizing and smoothing out the skin around my eyes.  The cream comes in a small pump bottle, and you really don't need a lot to get your skin moisturized.  The cream is lightweight, is absorbed quickly, and it really helps with the puffiness and tired look I get around my eyes in the morning.  I don't usually wear much make up (usually eye liner, mascara, and some lip gloss), so having this helped a lot.  I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about, but I absolutely love the scent of this cream.  It has a soft floral scent that definitely has tones of lily in it.  While I personally enjoy the scent, be warned that some people don't, so if you don't care for flowery scented lotion, I would steer clear as you will smell it.\n\nOverall, this cream has helped a lot with the dark circles and puffiness around my eyes.  I enjoyed how smoothly it went on, how lightweight it felt, and how great the skin around my eyes felt afterwards.",

This was yet another great read absorbing the reader into another world with lots of adventure and great commitary between all the characters allowing the reader to experience more views and personalities. Main female lead did not disappoint in her fierceness, and her beliefs for what she felt morally right. Lead male lead is uplifting with the constant supporting to the female lead in all and any aspect. Something not practiced in moderate society, making for a enjoyqble read I always appreciate. Supporting characters are great and easily lovable making the read that much better.",

            "On a mission to find the perfect canister vacuum with above-floor dusting capabilities:\n\nI swore I'd never own a Eureka vacuum cleaner ever again! I've had 3 that were miserable pieces of junk. However, the local vacuum cleaner store insisted that I examine the features before storming out of the store, so reluctantly I did. Not only was I surprised, I bought the thing, and it has replaced my less-than-a-year old Bosch because it's so much better.\n\nI need a good canister vacuum for my hard floors AND I need it to do extensive \"above the floor\" vacuum dusting for table tops, lamps, blinds, upholstry etc. It needs to be strong enough to remove the fur of two German Shepherd Dogs as well as seeds & feathers from my African Gray Parrot.\n\nThe attachments that come with it are user-friendly -a crevice tool & a two-in one dusting brush / upholstry brush combo. I did purchase the better quality dusting brush as an acccessory. And, my Dyson power-head for fur removal from upholstry fits the wands perfectly. (Not so lucky with the Bosch I just gave away)\n\nSuction is excellent. It's adjustable for vacuuming throw rugs. Wands simply pull apart -no tabs to lock together- which makes it faster when you want to add a brush. Wands are made of plastic rather than metal & I've found they attract dog fur through electrostatic energy. So, I gave them a spraying with \"Static Guard\" & voila - no more fur sticking to them!\n\nThis little guy maneuvers easily & is lightweight. It stores easily as well because of it's small size. Bags are small, but they hold an entire houseful of fur so I only have to change them after one cleaning. Some of the \"bagless\" vacs I've used required frequent emptying for the duration of household cleaning.\n\nI didn't give this little guy 5 stars because it doesn't have an automatic cord rewind. I've been spoiled by my other vacs which had them. The cord is much longer than the one on the Bosch I just got rid of. It's long enough to enable me to do two rooms, however, it's cumbersome to wrap underneath the vacuum when done. That's the ONLY fault I have with this unit.\n\nIf you need a suction-only vacuum for hard floors with the ability to vacuum dust above them, this is the vacuum for you. It's an amazing little vac without all the expensive frills of higher priced units and does an amazing job for a tiny price tag. I think I'm going to keep this one around for a LOOOOOONG time.",

It has freed me up considerably in doing tasks around the house and keeping track of schedules because I don't have to worry about stepping out of hearing range and not hearing the alarm, it goes where I go.

            "When the question is asked, \"What pop singer did the best jazz standards covers,\" answers that tend to pop up are Linda Ronstadt and Rod Stewart.  No, actually: Rickie Lee Jones' \"Pop Pop\" is the one.  I'd give it 4 and 1/2, in truth; but the \"best of\" anything, no matter how esoteric, ultimately gets 5 in my book.  The selections that stick with me are \"Love Junkyard,\" \"Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most,\" and \"My One and Only Love.\"  Ms. Jones has a most interesting voice:  at once playful and plaintive, worldly and coquettish.  I've heard slightly better covers of these done by Mark Murphy,Johnny Hartman and the New York Voices, among others:  but if Rickie Lee Jones leads you to singers like Mark Murphy, Johnny Hartman and the New York Voices, she's definitely worth the ride.

This is the least straightforward cd ever made in the popular music scene (I can't speak for college radio or underground) and it is incomprehensible at times, boring at times, and thrilling at times.  There are a good number of tracks that have a strange sound that really hurts your ears as it builds, then it goes into a normal song.  Many songs are haunting and depressing.  However, if you expect something like the Cure's Disintigration or something, you are in for a major surprise.  I would suggest you get Undertow before this cd, its much more accessible.  but do check this music out; it is quite disturbing and frankly, too stale in bits for most people.",

Turns out I was completely wrong. The Youth Oil has a beautiful scent when you put it on and fades away over hours.\n\nI followed the directions and put it on in the evening and after only one day, I could feel that my face felt softer to the touch. After a week, it feels really soft. I use only a drop or two an evening and at that rate, this bottle will last a long time. I thought it was rather expensive but when the price is broken out over at least three months (which is what I am currently estimating for my use), it won't be any more expensive than some of the moisturizing products that I already use from Clinique.\n\nThe bottle is lovely to look at and the dropper is easy to use. Just a drop or two into your hand and work into into your face using both hands - that's as simple as it can get. It only takes a minute or two to apply. I then rub the remaining oil into the backs of my hands - which are now feeling softer, too. I figure why waste even a tad of a drop?\n\nThis is a product that I will continue to use in the future and I recommend it to anyone with dry skin to help keep your skin as moist as possible.",

That album really set a standard for this sort of  soundtrack-ish material, and as such, anything following it is like to  appear diminshed by comparison. But then again, some of what is here is  really weaker, such as the title track, and the reliance on the Greenwich  talking clock that occurs at a couple of places really seems a bit mawkish.  And overall, the composition work here appears to be a bit off of  \"Heaven and Hell\"'s mark...but then, that really was a masterwork  piece, and certainly a difficult act to follow. But the performances here  are, once again, top-notch from one of the best synthesists of the 70s and  80s. Well worth picking up.",

The writing ability of each track has matured & the musicianship seems alot tighter & cleaner too.

            "So a couple of things to note about this game that others might find useful. Yes, I am  GoT fan, but I  also enjoying some of these living card / deck building games that are not genre or fan specific like Dominion. I think someone who enjoys games can find this game worthwhile even if they are not a fan of the series, book or movie.\n\nNow in the way of components, the game has a lot to offer. The tokens are quality cardboard, not super thin and I had no issues popping them out without tears or ripping. I wish they had a baggie or something to store them in instead of just an open space in the box, but that can be remedied easily enough. Now the cards contain really nice artwork to the point where after time, your eye is going to easily recognized the cards since they're so unique, well themed and reflect a scene that the actions and text of the card refer to. I mean I really enjoy these. They do seem a little on the large side, but it's been so long since I've used just regular play cards maybe I am just used to the small ones now.\n\nAnyway, as far as gameplay goes, what I really like about this game is you are playing a faction, or as fans might call them, a House (except the Nigh Watch which might be the reason for the faction statement. This isn't just a color or a visual difference. The cards you play are going to change based on this faction and therefore how you play might adjust itself as well. Since Jon Snow and Cersei have different strengths, you're probably going to wind up playing to the strengths of the best cards you have available. Although this is a deck-building game, there are nice suggestions on what cards to start with in a deck, and I always find that is the best approach to take until everyone is comfortable enough with the cards to choose a playing style.\n\nNow I haven't played a lot of Fantasy Flight Games, odd I know as a person who really enjoys physical games. I don't know if they normally do this or not, but i was a little disappointed that the tutorial is 2 player based for a game that advertises 2-4 players. In most cases, I am always going to have 3 or more people learning a new game with me as most the games I play start with a minimum of 3 anyway. The Joust rules are clear,  shows examples, and well everything a tutorial should be. The Melee Rules , the rules for 3 to 6 players (6 with expansions) and covered on 2 pages compared to the 8 for the tutorial. This isn't to say the tutorial isn't useful for 3... I just wish  they had focused on 3 instead of two. With the tutorial and the melee rules, the game proved a little challenging to pick up but not impossible. I am sure it will flow naturally after a few more play throughs.\n\nNow about the second book, the Rules Reference. I feel like companies are often trying to design their games so you don't have to reference additional sources while playing, which is great... however, many of them fail in this effort, so I really appreciate having physical reference should a question come up like the word Cannot is absolute cannot be countermanded by other abilities. This is the kind of granular questions either new players need to clear things up or seasoned players need to reference to settle disagreement.\n\nOverall, the game flows nicely, gives a nice nod to fans of the series and is in a relatively small and quality box to remain on the active and ready to play shelf of my collection. it's also small enough to carry around too. I would say the play is closer to 2 hours then 1 when you have any new players at all (they won't know the symbols and have to look them up a lot. They're all over the cards). I am not yet compelled to run out and buy more of the game, but you never know, it has the potential to be a favorite.\n\nI will definitely not think twice about buying more FFG games in the future as well. This is quality stuff although they could work on their box storage a bit. I know there's a company out there making quality inserts to remedy this problem, but I would prefer to just get good storage options for the box, well out of the box.",

His books have been readable and frequently revolve around ideas that I think about for some time after I've finished the book.  I don't know what happened with Hull Zero Three.  The book is tedious and boring.  The plot meanders along in an easily anticipated way.  None of the characters really draw you in. There is little in the way of unexpected drama in the plot.

I kept waiting for the hero to actually stand up and be a hero and go after what he wanted, but that never happened. After investing my time in the book I was left utterly disenchanted and disappointed. The reason it got two stars instead of one? Well, one - I got the book for free, two - it did have potential and probably would have forgiven everything (yes even the bad editing) if the hero had that man up moment and went after what he wanted at anytime, but third - most of all because I liked the first book The lonely millionaire and enjoyed seeing the characters again.

            "Hay veces que una novela puede ser muy interesante, pero llevada a pantalla no tiene el mismo efecto. Un producto de calidad del que se esperaba mucho más. \nTodo hacía prever que nos encontraríamos con una más que interesante propuesta del director de Atrapado por su pasado, ya que junto a él nos encontramos con grandes nombres dentro del mundo cinematográfico, pero aun así La Dalia negra no consigue sobresalir como película.Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johannson, Aarón Eckhart y Hillary Swank bajo la dirección de De Palma y con un guión de Josh Friedman basado en la novela de James Ellroy, (quien escribió la magnífica novela L.A. Confidencial), nos introducen en los años cuarenta, en las calles y en los problemas que existen en la meca del cine, de la mano de un tandem de policías y buenos boxeadores como son Harnet y Eckhart (Bucky Bleichert/Sr. Hielo y Lee Blanchard/Sr. Fuego). Un crimen desatará los círculos viciosos y las posibles bifurcaciones que deberá interpretar el bueno Bucky para llegar a resolverlo. Pero una cosa es que lo haga el personaje y otra el espectador, que a mitad de la película comienza a estar bastante perdido y que a menudo envidia a los policías que ve en pantalla, ya que necesitaría su libreta y su lapicero para poder apuntar y hacer los esquemas necesarios para no acabar desorientado. Hay veces que una novela puede ser muy interesante, pero llevada a pantalla no tiene el mismo efecto. En el apartado técnico nada que objetar, una buena fotografía, una dirección artística acorde con la época y con las condiciones sociales de cada personaje y con la zona en que se mueven, vestuario y demás también cumplen a la perfección. En el apartado interpretativo la verdad es que también están correctos, un buen casting con muchos rostros conocidos y que ya hemos comentado. Muchos se preguntarán que entonces ¿cómo es posible que el resultado no sea excelente? Y la respuesta es sencilla: el guión. Normalmente todas las películas que vemos cuentan con profesionales que logran que la mayoría de apartados técnicos sean lo suficientemente buenos como para pasar desapercibidos, y cuando algo nos falla o no termina de gustarnos la película, suele ser por el mismo mal endémico: el guión. En definitiva un producto de calidad del que se esperaba mucho más. Afortunadamente la próxima semana nos llegan las nuevas películas de otros dos maestros como son Scorsese y Allen. ",

In every fight scene in this movie \"Bruce\" flips flies and defies gravity at every turn, the type of \"wire-fu\" that the real Bruce Lee HATED! Bruce did NOT get into a fight (on the set of The BIg Boss) with a revenge seeking brother of a defeated foe, as Bruce injured his back LIFTING WEIGHTS not fighting some long-haired extra from a bad chop-sockey movie, a term BTW which is used in the film in what is supposed to be the 60's a decade before it was ever coined...lets see what else...The Tao of Jeet Kune Do was published AFTER Bruce died... Lee was already running his own kung-fu school (in Seattle) when he met his wife-to-be; he did not open this school at her suggestion, as the film indicates...Lee did NOT suffer from hallucinations, Lee began training at age 13 not as a child as depicted, Bruce was a successful child star with some 10+ films to his credit before going to America in 1958 not 1961 as stated in the movie...ARRRRGGGHHHHH......just be warned EVERYTHING in this movie has NOTHING to do with Bruce Lee's real life, art and philosophy.

            "While the hard case has protected my palm from a couple of falls onto hard pavement, it obviously wasn't designed by the same folks who designed the cradle. Moreover it has a fundamental design flaw that I find extremely frustrating: you can only put the palm in one way -- so that it opens in typical book fashion. In other words, the slider on the hard case will only go into the slot on the left edge of the palm. This is caused by two features of the front face: it is slightly deeper, and it has milled areas for the buttons. How hard would it have been to make the case symmetric so you could mount the palm the other way?\nWhy I would like to mount the palm the other way? Well, the obvious way to mount it is the way the case is designed for: book style. The less obvious but *superior* way for a right-handed person is to have the case mounted in the right edge slot. This makes it much easier to hold the palm with your left hand, and in addition it allows you to operate the palm with your right hand solo by holding the open face of the case against your knee. If you are right-handed and don't believe me, try putting the palm in the hard case slider into the right slot so it opens from the back. (You can install it this way; it just won't close properly because of the flawed design.) Now open it, grab the stylus in your right hand, put the right flap of the case on your knee, and put your hand down on it to hold it. You'll see how much easier it is to operate. Now try holding the palm in your left hand and you'll see that it's easier to operate in this fashion also.\nNow don't misunderstand me to be saying the case should be designed for right-handed people. I'm saying it should be designed so that you can mount the palm from either side so that both right- and left-handed people can use it comfortably. The current design is better for southpaws. I guess there's some sort of poetic justice there.",

However the fact that every time the movie is stopped it starts over from the beginning is a real negative compared to the standard DVD which will remember where it was.  Stop the movie to feed the kid -- it starts over.  Stop it to answer the phone, again a restart.  I think I must have seen the opening credits at least 10 times just to watch the movie through once!  This is inexcusable since blu ray can be authored to remember location.  Also the menu set up for the extras is bizzare -- a ribbon at the bottom of the screen that cannot be accessed until the opening sequence of the movie starts.  If you have a big enough screen to benefit from the additional detail of blu ray you might want to consider buying this edition, however unless you watch your movies all the way through in one sitting with no interuptions be prepared for frustration.",

After installing it I noticed that whenever I filled out a form, particularly an Outlook (OWA)email, and sent the message the parent browser window would close.

I won't trouble you with all the details,but the guy told me I had a virus and it would cost me $99 for them to fix it. I explained to him that the 2007 version never found any virus and this only occurred after installing 2008. I uninstalled 2008 and reinstalled 2007 the problem went away.

            "The chain that came with my saw was magnificent.  Over six weeks I cut enough firewood--(oak, manzanita & madrone) to fill a 16 ft Uhaul truck to the ceiling. I was thrilled.  At a $15 replacement price it didn't seem worth the time to sharpen them.  I ordered 2 replacements when it began to fade.  Even with free shipping (10 days) I was still using the original when the new ones arrived.\n\nThe first replacement lasted 15 minutes. The second one made it about 4 days.  More orders followed quickly: The third's a question mark (My fault: it loosened & self-destructed when it slipped the bar).  In the four after that, only one made it through ten days of intermittent use.  The accumulated firewood from all the all 7 replacements is nowhere near the total output of the original chain.  So either A) the first one was a fluke, or B) Husqvarna makes 2 different grades of chains, or C) their quality is so capricious as to make each purchase into chain saw roulette.\n\nSuddenly the appeal of home sharpening is blindingly obvious.  I like my Husqvarna saw, but from now on I'll sharpen the chains I have.  I'll buy more new ones only when the last one is worn away.",

It is better than nothing but just barely. I haven't tried the other version on Amazon made by OTC. That one seems better as it has an extra slot to help hold the belt better which would make sense. Also the metal is too slippery so it doesn't keep the belt on the tool and always falls off the tool. The tool should be rubberized at least in the area where it comes into contact with the belt. This would keep the belt on better with a rubber grip.

            "I've been a very satisfied customer for over 2 years using the Alpha I case for iPhone 4 and their ZERO Poly ultra-thin snap-on case.  The ZERO protects my iPhone when not in the leather case, and the iPhone and ZERO fit nicely into the Alpha I for iPhone 4.\nMy first one lasted 2 years before it started looking a bit too tattered.  This past Christmas, my family bought me a new one.  Now, I decided to upgrade my iPhone 4 to a iPhone 5 so in anticipation of the upgrade, I purchased a ZERO and a Alpha I for iPhone 5.\nToday, I got the iPhone 5.  The ZERO snapped right on and works just as fabulous as the original.  To my disappointment, the set would not fit into the Alpha I for iPhone 5.  The new Alpha I was made with absolutely zero tolerance (and zero tolerance for their ZERO case!).\n\nWith others here stating their iPhone 5 is too tight (without a snap-case on it), I think Splash is making the Alpha I for iPhone 5 too small.  Alpha 1 + ZERO is a perfect combo.  Now, I have ordered the bulkier-looking Alpha II.  Hopefully it works, or else I have to shop the market for cheap Chinese cases that will fit.\n\nUpdate: I got the Alpha II. Piece of junk.  I thought the Alpha II would be just a larger version of the Alpha I, but instead, it's a different case design (only elastic on the sides, no leather), and while they say \"Napa Leather\", it's more like cheap, thin, plastic leather.  Since the sides are only partially covered, if you drop it, you run the risk of the top or bottom of your phone getting dinged up (which happened to me...thankfully I keep a ZERO slim case on mine so only the ZERO got dinged).  Also, I emailed Splash support with my feedback and after a few weeks, they have not even bothered to respond.",

            "This may well be a classic in the future, judging by the critical response and, well, I am saddened by the realization. Don't get me wrong, characterization and an eloquent writing style elevate this novel over the crowd, but midway through the book, I began to wonder whether the fine writing was more than a clever gimmick and whether anything of substance underlay the delicate descriptive passages. Oftentimes, I had to wonder whether we were discovering anything new as we learned more and more about depression and Alzheimer's disease. 40 pages would go by and the author would sing the same song, so consumed by the art of writing, by the creative process of devising new ways to describe the ordinary, that his message began to suffer. Soon I had to conclude that hiding behind the clever, page-long metaphors were empty revelations and lackluster observations of the human condition (Al's business trip describes his dissatisfaction with his wife; it took some 30 pages where 1 or 2 would suffice)\nOn the whole, the absence of heroic characters surprised me. Not that I expect an author to present his characters sugar-coated and on a pedestal. What I missed was an insight into their souls. None of his characters seemed admirable people. Instead, Franzen, much like American media and America in general, appeared obsessed by the private life, by the substance behind the barrier that separates the private and the public. And that did not make his characters more real or genuine to me. Ever since I saw Election, I question whether such attention to 'complete reality' is interesting, revealing, ground-breaking, or simply plays on our desire to be shocked. Is Mr. Franzen really convinced that all of us are just like the Lamberts? I don't think that that is the conclusion. More like is that Mr. Franzen simply considered the shocking as the only unexplored. I don't know, I can't really form a final opinion on the subject. While I read I was too preoccupied reading about out-of-control body-excrements, depression and Alzheimer's to form a conclusion. And I am not that interested in reading the whole book again.\nWhat I did like, was one impression the book left behind: our lives are full of white lies and pretences; just think how we would feel if a disgruntled European told us face to face unabashedly what they think of us Americans (something the Europeans, bless their souls, are found of doing). We would dislike him instantly but never say so openly. Our society is simply build on pretences and it will not change. And that is what Mr. Franzen's characters must combat. Franzen seems to conclude in the end that to have what it takes to change ourselves is culture shock, war, death, those types of Earth-shuttering events that destroy our belief-system. Is that something new? No. And that is what saddens me. That we offer Mr. Franzen's book as the high point of our fiction, where comparisons to great fiction would be insulting. I think that the book was well chosen for Oprah's book club. It had a nice point of view to drive home about the American Family in the post world war II era. Nothing shattering though, just creative writing that may go too far for some.",

            "終戦後の占領統治下で、東京裁判と並行して政府の下でこのような調査会が行われていたこと自体はあまり知られておらず、戦争拡大に反対した政財界の有力者が戦争直後にどのような発言をしていたのかを知るのは興味深いことである。 しかし、個々の有力者の発言は各自の意見の域を出るものではなく、歴史の検証としては昭和前期の詳細な歴史資料で客観的な研究がすでに多数存在している。 そして、戦争調査会が途中で廃止された経緯が、委員に軍の幹部が複数入っていることに対し対日理事会のソ連や英国らから批判がなされたことにある以上、調査会の存在自体がいかにも中途半端なものだったという感を免れない。著者はその点に問題意識を持っていないようだが、戦争調査会の最も厳しい調査対象とされるべき軍の幹部が調査する側の委員になっている点は、その公平性と第三者性を疑われて当然のことである。 そのことは、調査会の議論の紹介で、戦争原因の起源を第一次大戦後に求め、大正デモクラシーの軍批判が軍の反発を招いたとか、大戦後の海軍軍縮で国際協調のために戦艦保有の微々たる削減をすべきでなかったかのような軍に配慮した議論を無批判に紹介している点にもあらわれている。しかし、問題は軍がなぜこれだけ発言力を持ち、世論や政治のコントロールがきかずに暴走していったのかにあるので、大正デモクラシーや軍縮の努力を批判するのは全く倒錯している。軍の暴走の起源こそこの著者が論点からはずそうとしている明治国家の体制であり、日清日露戦争後の朝鮮と満州の植民地化であろう。 著書は戦争調査会が廃止された後の部分で戦争回避の可能性について考察しているが、これも皮相であるといわざるをえない。 確かに、満州事変から日中開戦、日米開戦に至る個々の局面では戦争拡大を回避する方策があり得たし、実際にそのような努力もなされていた（そのこと自体は歴史研究ですでに示されている）。しかし、問題はなぜ政治家の戦争回避の努力がことごとく失敗し、展望のない日中開戦や日米開戦の泥沼にはまり込み、ミッドウェー海戦以後は敗戦確実な状況となったのに終戦の決断ができずにずるずると悲惨な玉砕や特攻戦を続け、ついには沖縄地上戦や原爆の悲劇に至ったのかということだろう。 それはやはり軍の暴走を止められない国家体制をつくってしまった明治国家以来の問題にあるわけであり、その点を掘り下げずに個々の局面の戦争回避の可能性だけをあげてみてもむなしい議論である。",

The director has never been charged with a crime.\n Allen   82  won Oscars for the films \"Annie Hall \" \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" and the 2011 comedy \"Midnight in Paris \" and continues to release a new movie almost every year.\nTimothy Chaplet  22  the star of gay romance \"Call me By Your Name \" this week became the latest actor to announce he will donate the salary he earned from an  Allen  movie to \"Time's Up\" and other causes for sexual abuse victims.\nHe followed Rebecca Hall  Ellen Page and Mira Sorkin who have made donations or issued regrets about working with  Allen  in recent weeks. Last week \"Lady Bird\" director Greta Gehrig  who acted in the 2012 film \"To Rome with Love \" said she would not work with  Allen  again.\n Allen 's most recent film \"Wonder Wheel \" distributed by Amazon Studios  has fared poorly at the North American box office taking only $1.4 million since its Dec. 1 release.\n His  next film \"A Rainy Day in New York \" starring Chaplet and also from Amazon  is due for release later this year.",

Y bueno. \nEste filón Blockbuster puede conducir a la confusión porque contiene la semilla de una franquicia, con todo cuanto el negocio el cine es capaz de producir, y también ciertos rasgos de cine bien hecho con retazos de cine digno tratándose de un producto tan premeditamente pergeñado a la chiquillería golosa de trajes que vuelan y poderes sobrenaturales escondidas bajo una gabardina. Y Bryan Singer, director fetiche del mundo del cómic tra sus dos competentes X-men ( no así el tercero, manoseado por un ramplón Ratner, cuela en las dos horas y media de metraje alguna evidencia de su particular visión del héroe, ignoramos si con la anuencia de la productora, que podría ver peligrar la caja si Superman nos sale un parlanchín dramático o un gurú de la mística posmoderna. Singer hace, ahí es nada, un Superman religioso, adulto y hasta débil, esto es, humano. Quiere Singer demostrar que se puede perpetrar un film de superhéroes sin bajarse el pantalón en exceso y lo hace con un plantel de actores muy bien buscado ( tampoco el Superman de Donner era manco en este aspecto ) y un guión milimétrico que traba el forma meramente visual ( cebo para devoradores de cómics, pongo por caso ) con el fondo metafísico. Sí. Lo que pasa es que toda esta arquitectura de propósitos se desmembra cuando la película lleva veinte minutos y ya hemos visto prácticamente todo lo que esperábamos ver. Kevin Spacey, que deja su teatro londinense para hinchar su cuenta con un personaje nutritivo, es un Lex Luthor más cercano al Hannibal Lecter más morboso que al malo-malísimo, blando en el fondo, caricaturizado en anteriores entregas, al que estábamos acostumbrados. Satura el merchandising, pero esto es inevitable. Más cuando el estreno es en verano y las colas del cine se amogollonan de familias enteras en busca de dos horas de plácido asueto trufado de un par de kilos de efectos especiales. Mi hijo disfrutó de lo lindo. El padre ejerció de padre responsable y recordó que también, a su edad, fue llevado por un tío a ver la película del primer Christopher Reeves. Si el futurible espectador tiene hijos, dele un ración de héroe. Es un icono de este último siglo fugado. Sí carece de este perfil, vaya a ver Zulo, que va de otra cosa y también es cine. Y bueno.

In short, I'd spend the extra $40-$60 or so bucks and get a better quality set. I bought these to replace a pair of Bushnell's I had stolen.

We have captured many bugs and creatures over the years and love watching their fascinating habits.  I sent off for ants and was pleasantly surprised that it only took about 2 weeks to receive them.  Most were alive and we ended up with about 20.  We put them in and waited for the digging to commence.  And waited.  And waited.  We waited over 48 hours and I was truly feeling sorry for the little guys.  They were desperate to get out of the wicked contraption and were obviously wearing themselves out trying to climb the unforgiving plastic walls over and over again.  The 2 that made it down a pre-made tunnel were obviously stuck and suffocating.  I was mortified at the thought that my 5 year-old (and myself as well) had to watch the slow and painfully sad demise of the little guys.\n\nWe ended up frantically scouring the stores today to find a replacement habitat for them.  We settled on the ant hill version with sand instead of gel.  I got them in without a hitch and dug the 2 that were suffocating out of the gel.  They seem to be fine now.  It took the little guys less than 10 minutes to start doing their \"thing.\"  I was SO relieved to see them scurrying about and digging in the sand.  Hopefully this will end in an educational and pleasant experience for my daughter.\n\nAvoid this product like the plague.  You'll live a more fruitful life without it...",

            "Summary:\nI bought my C5 mower through a special offer from our electric utility at $[...] delivered. In my opinion it is it is almost worth that amount, but at $[...] it is way overpriced for what it can do. If you want to do anything more than cut grass slowly, go with a gas mower.\n\nPros:\nLight, no gasoline or oil, minimal maintenance, easy start, quiet, well constructed.\n\nCons:\nPoorly designed handle, cut is only fair, mulches poorly, mediocre bagging, bag is small, narrow cut, overpriced, poor battery life.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nBuy it if you have small clean yard and the price is less than $[...]. It will work. Do not get the trimmer, a separate one is much more versatile.\n\nTips:\nThe battery is pricey from DR [..].  You can find UB12100 batteries online that will end up costing about half what your pay from DR.  You need two UB12100 batteries and a #15 torx driver to change out the batteries in the case that comes with the mower (I do not know for sure but I would guess that the C6 takes 3 batteries).  The savings is about [..].\n\nThis mower cuts grass and that is about all. It does cut St. Augustine grass, but with no particular distinction. It does not cut as well as a good gas mower but it will compete with an average mower to merely cut grass. It does not mulch well and leaves fairly large pieces of leaves and noticeable grass clippings. If the yard is leaf free, after using the mulch attachment it looks OK. It does not bag the leaves very well and there remains a significant amount of residue. The wheels are not offset enough and the plastic body rather thick preventing close mowing against fences and walls.  The hand grip is poorly designed and requires a healthy grip and good size hands to keep the mower from constantly turning motor on and off increasing the battery drain significantly.\n\nIt is light and easy to maneuver even on a slope or over curbs. Since it is electric there are no gas cans, carburetor, no oil changes, no smell in the garage and no problem starting it. It is blessedly quiet. For those features alone it may be worthwhile.  However, on the downside if it needs a new battery every year at $[...] from DR, you have to weigh the cost of that silence.",

I finally decided to come back and write a review.  I don't usually write reviews, but didn't want someone else to make the same mistake.\n\nWe've used this thing maybe 10-12 times since we bought it.  I know that doesn't sound like a lot, and you're right!  The reason is because the battery will not stay charged long enough.  We keep the batteries charged, so when they die on us we can switch them out.  The final straw came the other day when I pulled the vac out to use, the battery died about 15 seconds after I started it.  I switched the battery out for the fresh, fully charged spare, and it went for literally 45 seconds before dying.\n\nI guess being called \"Eureka\" is right - because all I could think was \"Eureka - that didn't last long at all!\"  The longest I think this has ever run on a fully charged battery for us is about 2 minutes.\n\nI know - its not intended to be a vacuum replacement.  That's not why we bought it.  We bought it for quick spills, crumbs, etc.  We never intended on using it for anything else.  Sadly, we can't even use it on that.  Please - don't make the same mistake we did.  Its not worth it.  I read all the reviews - I did my research - but this one doesn't measure up.",

            "I too was suckered into buying this after seeing it on sale at a local shop. After playing it I thought that \"Come and Get Your Love\" sounded a bit different, but one of their other hits, \"The Witch Queen of New Orleans\" sounded very different from what I remembered. It appears that these are all re-recorded versions, and it's not clear if it's by members of the original band or not. This CD gives you zero information about the musicians or anything else other than standard songwriting credits and track times. The rest of the tracks on this VERY short CD are either lame remakes like \"Poison Ivy\" or watered down pop tunes. The only track that hints of the band's Native American origins is \"We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee.\" Some actual lyrical depth to that tune, as opposed to most the other disposable stuff on here, although the remake of \"But It's All Right\" is pleasant.

It was extremely difficult to get an equal distribution of gathering as the string was pulled.  If the gathering isn't even around the edge the cover won't fit snugly and will come off in a stiff breeze).\nI did like the external handles but found the air vents inadequate to let breezes flow out.\nBecause of the bad fit and vent system the cover needed lots of adjustments throughout the season.

            "The great thing about this game are the options available. Player creation, coaches, outfits are all very good. But, I have to admit like the others have said, the game takes a long time to load. First, you have to load to get to the menu. That takes a while. Then, you have to load career. That takes longer. Then, you you have to load the tournament....which also takes a long time. Aah, finally...that is what you wanted to hear me say, isn't it? No....it is still not over yet. You now have to load the match!\n\nI have a very fast PC with a damn good graphics accelerator. Still, it takes such a long time to load.\n\nThere are graphic glitches as well. Sometimes, everything goes in slow motion or the screen freezes. It happens occasionally. And from what I know about tennis, ball boys are supposed to pick up the ball when it hits the net, which they don't. They just run leaving the ball where it is. It looks silly when they do that. One other reviewer mentioned that having the Number 1 and Number 2 player in the same draw is an inexcusable error. Boy, was that an understatement? I guess he was being nice. Almost all the top players are put in one draw and the rest are put in the other. This is a mockery of tennis.\n\nOther major goof ups: The whole attitude stuff after each point is silly and extremely irritating to say the least. Watch some professional tennis matches and tell me which player does those stupid attitude things. This is not a popularity contest. This is tennis. No player I remember ever does the things they show in this game, unless they are big time jerks.\n\nThere are no replays, which is not realistic. And as far as I can remember, I have never seen anyone playing tennis with pants in grand slam events. It looks pathetic. This is the 21st century. Not early 1900s. The entire rival player idea is pathetic. The player's rival loses in the first round of every tournament, yet keeps rising up in the rankings rapidly. That is plainly impossible. And the stupid e-mails the rivals send make these players look like a bunch of 12-year-olds getting at each other. There was no need for a rival scenario in the game. It just makes the game look ridiculously stupid. And in the real world, a player's major rival is almost always from a different country. Federer-Nadal, Edberg-Becker, Graf-Seles...so on. Sampras-Agassi was one major exception.\n\nBut, the bottom line, is it fun to play? It is if you can ignore the comments from your rival. Less than $10 for this game is a reasonable price, which is what is charged here. But, the errors should make you think twice about buying this game for a higher price. Tennis is definitely better, however, on many levels. Tennis Masters Series by Microids could have easily beaten this game as being the best out there. But what was lacking there were a lot options available in Top Spin.\n\nI have no idea how Top Spin 3 fares in comparison. But, I can tell you that the makers of that game decided to isolate the PC gamers. But, I cannot blame 2K for that entirely. This trend has been going on for a while. EA, 2K, and several gaming organizations are slowly doing away with the manufacture of PC games. That means the gaming users need to adapt and get the consoles. In other words, unfortunately, what medium we choose to entertain ourselves is governed by powerful organizations, and this is no different in the gaming industry; so, we need to change.",

Now I realized how bad of taste I had though. There wasn't anything on this I like now.\n\"MMM Bop\" didn't even have all real words which really [wasn't good]. You don't do warmups on albums, unless you label it \"interlude\". \"Where's The Love\", the second single on this album, is okay though. It isn't memorable though. Then, there was \"I Will Come To You\". Great if you like the lovey dovey music. BUt I like BBMak better and they play their instruments. Sadly, I had a much deeper voice at the time I was 13, the age of Taylor. Then there's wining on \"Speechless\", a song about a girl they like but are worried that since she (isn't it?) doesn't like them. There's also \"Weird\". It reminds me of a country song. While there were a lot more tolerable points of The Jacksons, this falls flat. Again it is giving me bad memories.\n\"With You In Your Dreams\" is meaningful honestly though. Because it is dedicated to their late grandma and has a meaning. \"Look At You\" is another senseless song.\nI happen to like the \"geek-rock\" movement made by Weezer a lot more on its lyrics that make no sense over Middle of Nowhere by Hanson.\nGreat CD overall....

Aiming system and driving physics were all greatly altered from vice City to this one. And all for the worse. I had some strange glitches in which I would enter a building to either customize hair or change clothes, whatever it was the character would never come out.

It's caller ID-ready, has good noise reduction and has a speed dial function and mute button. In addition, Plantronics has one of the best warranties I've ever experienced. I simply called when my first phone stopped working and they sent a new one within a couple of days, no hassle, no paperwork. So why only two stars?\n\nFirst, the belt clip is inadequate (especially for those of us who never wear belts.) The clip is too weak to clip to jeans, so I always have to wear a shirt with a pocket in order to have a place to put the phone. This is a serious flaw, as I discovered the clip's weakness only after the phone fell off my pants and onto the floor the first few times I tried it.\n\nSecond, the number pad is frustratingly small. It is easy to misdial with keys the size of a pencil eraser.\n\nThird, and most important, the unit's phone jack seems to have a design flaw. I am on my second phone within one year and each one has, over several months, started crackling and cutting out. At first I thought it was the headset, since holding the cord a certain way would eliminate the crackling sound. On a hunch, I bought a new headset from another manufacturer, plugged it in, and immediately started getting the crackling noise. Now that my warranty has expired, I will not be buying a replacement phone, but looking for a new manufacturer altogether. A real pity, I loved this phone.",

            "(This review applies to all editions.)\n\nChoosing a holy book is harder than choosing a romance novel. To help you choose, I will compare this one to another best-seller in this category, the Quran. These are the two holy books that get the most buzz around here.\n\nBased on all the marketing hype, I expected these two books would be really different. All readers like one or the other, never both, and they all HATE the other book. However, these two books turned out to be a lot more similar than their marketing led me to expect.\n\nFor example, to judge from the marketing propaganda, many men choose a holy book based on how many virgins or wives they can have. If you are one of these men, you might think the Quran is the obvious choice for you. Not so! Buyers of the Bible can have lots of virgins too, and also multiple wives and plenty of sex slaves (called concubines in these holy books, which have their own special code words for dirty stuff). Abraham, a main character in this book (and also, coincidentally, in the Quran), had children with several concubines and a slave girl, while he was married to another woman. Lot even had children with his own two virgin daughters! No prudes here! Jacob, father of the twelve tribes at the center of the Bible plot, had two wives and two concubines at the same time. Solomon, another of the book's heroes, had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. Virgins are hot property in this book just like in the Quran. That's why the main character, Yahweh, always orders his followers to collect virgins after committing genocide. (One time they collected 32000 Midianite virgins!) I haven't done a virgin-by-virgin count, but my impression is that this book's virgin count is right up there with the Quran's.\n\nIt's tough to keep women under control, so if you are a man, it pays to buy a holy book that puts the fear of god in your wives and lovers. Again, men might think the Quran is the clear choice here. It is full of instructions for stoning rape victims and non-virgin brides, and for beating wives. The Bible PR team thinks this would hurt US sales, so they like to give the impression that the Bible is different on this score. However, it turns out that the Bible says pretty much the same thing:\n\"If ... the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die.\" Bible, Deuteronomy 22:13-21\n\"If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city.\" Bible, Deuteronomy 22:23-24\nSo male buyers, you don't have to go with the competition if you want to stone women. There is an important lesson here: DON'T LET THE MARKETERS FOOL YOU! Read these books for yourself before you decide on a purchase.\n\nIf you are a woman, there is not much to choose from here. My advice-- just buy the holy book that your husband or neighbors buy. And after you buy it, study it hard.\n\nAs a bonus feature, whether you are a man or a woman, you can use this book to control your children, as it tells you to kill them if they talk back: \"Whoever curses father or mother shall die\"  Bible, Mark 7:10. What teenager wouldn't behave, with that inscribed in big Gothic letters over his or her bedroom door?\n\nSometimes, abortions are necessary to save the life of the mother, and abortions can ensure that people don't have babies they can't raise. If you listen to the marketers, you might be thinking the Bible is a poor choice if you want to be flexible about abortions. But here too you would be wrong. Remember, DON'T TRUST THE MARKETERS, read the actual book before purchasing. The Bible is actually big on killing young children (see above) and unborn babies:\n\"Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.\" Bible, Psalm 137.\nYahweh also kills virtually all the pregnant women on earth (along with their unborn babies) in a big flood. He also repeatedly orders people to kill entire nations, including all their pregnant women and their unborn babies (of course, saving the virgins--see above). Sometimes he gets mad when his people don't kill them. So apparently this is all ok with him.\n\nBy the way, when this is mentioned to Bible marketers like William Lane Craig (from the \"Evangelical Christian\" marketing firm), they respond by saying that Yahweh did the kids and/or unborn fetuses a favor, because they go straight to heaven. Here is what WL Craig says about baby-killing, from his website:\n\n\"... if we believe, as I do, that God's grace is extended to those who die in infancy or as small children, the death of these children was actually their salvation.  We are so wedded to an earthly, naturalistic perspective that we forget that those who die are happy to quit this earth for heaven's incomparable joy.  Therefore, God does these children no wrong in taking their lives.\"\n\nSo apparently abortion and baby-killing is not only ok, but BETTER than having kids that might grow up to break some rule and not go to heaven.\n\nAnother thing to consider in any holy book is its treatment of \"days of rest\". Those days are nice, but sometimes you might need to cook or turn on a light or lift a rock that falls on your foot. So again, you want a holy book that is flexible. Here I am afraid you are out of luck, as both these books say you should be killed for doing things like that:\n\"They found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. ... And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones.... And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.\" Bible, Numbers 15:32-56\n\nWhat to do with people who criticize your purchase? It can be uncomfortable to be ridiculed for buying the wrong holy book, so I highly recommend buying one that tells you to kill anybody who bought a competing title. Again, marketers would have you believe that the Quran should be your choice here, but I found the Bible has this department covered just as well as the Quran:\n\"If there be found among you ... that ... hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them ... Then shalt thou ... stone them with stones, till they die.\" Bible, Deuteronomy 17:2-5\n\"They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.\"  Bible, 2 Chronicles 15:12-13\n\nOne downside to both books is the number of weird rules you must obey (e.g. no planting of two crops in the same field, or wearing clothes made of two kinds of threads). But don't worry, the Bible is so long that nobody actually reads the thing, so you can plausibly deny you ever saw those parts, or deny they exist. If that doesn't work, you can always say those parts were mistranslated.\n\nI have to warn you that there is a confusing change of the rules toward the end of the book, as noted by many other reviewers. Not to worry. The main character of that section, Jesus, says: \"For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law [the rules in the first section]...\" So as long as the stars are still shining at night, I guess you can pick your rules from either section. Polygamists and virgin-lovers will want to pay most attention to the first section.\n\nI conclude that because of their similarity, it is tough to choose between these two holy books. Their prices are also about the same, $5 to $15 + a chance at eternal damnation. Luckily there is one important difference between the Bible and Quran. You are not allowed to burn or destroy the Quran. On the other hand, after reading the Bible you can use the pages as tinder to light campfires or fireplaces, or use the whole thing as a doorstop. In this reviewer's opinion, that tips the balance in favor of the Bible over the Quran.\n\nAs an alternative, you might reconsider this whole holy book genre. These books don't get updated very often (the Bible's last update was 2000 years ago) so you may prefer something that incorporates all we have learned about the world since then. (For example, it turns out the world is not flat, the earth actually goes around the sun, and humans and animals didn't just appear magically all at once!!!) I see Richard Dawkins' \"The Magic of Reality\" is available on Amazon; that might be a good place to start for holy book fans who want to catch up on some of the really exciting post-Bronze-Age developments.",

            "The minute I saw Holly's (Sissy Spacek) reaction to her father's murder at the hands of Kit (Martin Sheen), I knew was in trouble. The problem was she didn't react. The very first murder taking place in a film about a killing spree was not exploited as what should have been an earth shattering moment for Holly. Badlands is loosely based on the \"Starkweather-Fugate\" killing spree of the 1950's. I know that in the medium of film things are romanticized. Even the worst situations look attractive to the viewer but the film gives the audience nothing to look at. Kit and Holly are painfully forgetable characters who coast through this film with a blase attitude. Kit just murders people left and right without batting an eye and Holly perfectly accepts what is occuring. What's even more infuritating is Holly's narration, which was unnecessary in general, was substituted for more crucial, emotional, character development. I was patiently awaiting for one of two moments; Kit, the violent sociopath who committed all the murders in the film, would finally unleash his fury on Holly or some sort of suspense in which the couple could be very well be killed by the authorties. Neither moment happened. Instead, Holly decided she just had enough and Kit simply turns himself into police custody. Again, neither person reacts to what was happening. Badlands is a beautifully shot film with talented actors but it's ulimately comes off as a juvenile fantasy.",

            "This book has so much potential, but it was a lost cause due to numerous distracting problems. Let's begin with the head hopping. The author jumped between the hero and the heroine's thoughts non stop. I'm talking within the same paragraph! It drove me crazy. It was hard to keep up with who was thinking what. The heroine started out strong and was likable, but seriously, I just couldn't buy into her going from being kidnapped by an Indian who didn't speak English, to being in love with him by the time they arrived to his village. And in love with him to the point that she was strong enough to endure torture for him. By the time I got to their marriage, I just couldn't read another word. I wouldn't normally review a book I couldn't finish, but this book has some serious problems. There are quite a few typos, spelling, and grammatical errors as well. I honestly tried to keep going, but after almost three weeks of picking it up and putting it down, I realized it wasn't worth the effort any longer. I hate to be so critical of a book because I know how much heart goes into writing fiction, but this book has too many issues and readers deserve to know before making a purchasing decision. I will say that I liked the heroine. She was a strong female protagonist. This book simply wasn't ready and needs some serious reshaping.",

            "Sean Hannity: Liberal media finally sees Bill Clinton for what he is 20 years too late\nWith allegations of sexual misconduct now swirling around U.S. Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore  the left and the liberal media are finally starting to take stock of their long-running defense of their favorite accused rapist and serial philanderer   Bill Clinton .\nConsider the liberal publication “The Atlantic ” which has published a story with this headline and introduction: “Bill Clinton: A Reckoning. Feminists saved the 42nd president of the United States in the 1990s. They were on the wrong side of history; is it finally time to make things right?\"\n“The accusers of Bill Clinton back in the '90s were never given the credence and treated with the same respect that [Moore’s accusers] are being treated ” CNN’s Jake Tapper said. “And I think that there is something to be said about how society has evolved since then but  in addition  it's hard not to look back at that period and think: you know what  the media treated those women poorly.”\nMembers of the mainstream media are actually starting to realize that what  Bill Clinton  did was beyond disgraceful. From sodomizing an intern to groping women to the alleged rape of Juanita Broaddrick  the allegations against  Clinton  have been known for years. Those of us who objected at the time were told by these same media outlets that all of this was his personal business. It did not “rise to the level of impeachment.”\nTwo decades later  the biased left-wing media outlets are coming to terms with what they said and did and how they covered it all up. Paula Jones  Gennifer Flowers  Kathleen Willey and several more women have all told how they were dismissed  smeared and left by the side of the road by the  Clinton  machine and the mainstream media.\nTo be sure  there was a reckoning in court. In 1998   Bill Clinton  ended up paying Paula Jones $850 000 in an out-of-court settlement for her to drop her sexual harassment charges against  him . And in a related case   Bill Clinton  actually lost  his  license to practice law in Arkansas for five years. And we know  Clinton  was impeached.\nBut to the media   he  remained a darling and a lovable rogue. What has changed? Well  maybe the media  like so many in the Democratic Party  is finally done with the Clintons. Maybe they want to look consistent when they go after Roy Moore  whose alleged transgressions pale in comparison.",

            "This can opener was given to us as a wedding present. We previously owned a Black & Decker cordless hand-held can opener which we loved and when it comes time to replace the Krups, we'll be looking for another Black  & Decker.\nOne of my primary complaints about this opener is what  makes it unique: the crimping edge which removes lids from the side instead  of the top. I often use canned items such as cranberry sauce or tomato  paste. The best and easiest way to remove the food from the can is to  remove both ends of the can and push one end through the can. The food is  removed from the can cleanly and completely. However, you can't do this  with the Krups Open Master Can Opener.\nAnother thing Krups could have  done to make this opener more versatile is to make it cordless instead of  having to be plugged into the wall. We have a large kitchen and it's much  easier for me to bring the opener to the food prep area than the other way  around. Unfortunately, there is no outlet near that end of the counter  area!\nAdditionally, the Krups is often difficult to attach to the cans  and I find myself using a hand held Swing-A-Way $5 opener 95% of the time  instead of the more expensive electric model.",

            "Great book, horrible edition.\n\nAs to the book itself, this is probably one of my favorites in all of AC's large collection. Although I love both Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, I must admit I love Miss Marple best, and this is Miss Marple at her finest.\n\nHaving said as much: I have read this book many, many times. For whatever reason, at a very young age I become an Agatha Christie fan and the result is that I have read many editions of the same book. In every edition there are typos. Human beings are human beings. But never have I encountered typos - and downright mistakes - as relentlessly inflicted as in this edition and particularly, in this book. Actually, I take that back. The Black Dog edition is even worse and should be used for kindling and nothing else. I have tried to put myself in the position of a typist  who cannot differentiate between \"anymore\" and \"any more\" and I have failed. I have tried to put myself in the position of a publishing company that doesn't care about the written word and I have failed. You would think, reading this review, that I am one of those little old retired English teachers who go around rapping people on their knuckles with a ruler. This is not so. I am a relatively normal human being. But I expect - perhaps wrongly - a publishing company to produce books that are faithful to the original. I expect that SOMEONE will proofread the edition before it goes to the presses. I expect someone besides me to care. As far as I know, publishing is not Harper Collins' side job. It was my impression that this is what they do and this is what they make a great deal of money off of. So why not do it well? The mystery of The Mirror Crack'd will eventually be revealed to you. The mystery of why HarperCollins treats book publishing as if it were a friendly game of cornhole has yet to be elucidated. My recommendation: read the book in another edition.",

            "I was lured away from the Netgear wireless broadband router by this unit's lower price and additional features, namely, the built-in print server (parallel port only).  It was easy to configure and began working right away on my 1-wired, 1-wireless home network.  The performance was good... for about 3 weeks.  Then one day, the performance got worse and worse, until it stopped responding to network traffic altogether.  It wouldn't respond to pings, even after leaving it powered down all night, and resetting it.\nI had read on other forums about problems with my particular version of this model (750.5435).  Apparently there is an older version (750.5312) that doesn't have these problems.\nWhen I contacted tech support (which was responsive on a Sunday morning), and gave them my model number, they knew what was coming.  We didn't go very deep into troubleshooting, beyond pinging & rebooting the PC.  The rep acknowledged that the other version works better, and is having one of those sent to me as a replacement.\nUpdate: I received the older model, and it did work better than the first unit.  But sustaned transfers (like a 1 megabyte download) over the wireless LAN would usually get stuck somewhere in the middle.  The wireless link itself stayed up, so I don't know if I can completely blame the router for this - maybe it's a bug in Windows TCP/IP stack, or an incompatability with the Linksys WPC11 PC card I use.  But regardless, I've never had this problem with my Netgear router, or public access points, so I'll stick with what works, and this isn't it.",

The material is rigid and rough, it's very uncomfortable and very cheaply made. I would not expect it to last very long. Prolonged use would undoubtedly leave the guitarist with an aching shoulder. The strap is also very short, so anyone who likes to play with their guitar low will definitely dislike this strap. Most importantly, though, the holes for the guitar pegs are way too small. So unless your guitar has locking tuners or unnaturally small strap pegs, this will NOT work for your guitar. Overall this is another very disappointing product from Ernie Ball. After several years of playing guitar I can't understand why they are considered to be \"name brand.\" Ernie Ball strings are poorly made and break regularly. The Ernie Ball wah effect pedal is also mediocre. I was hoping to redeem the company for myself by trying out their line of straps, but it was evidently a waste. Nobody should have to pay more than $20 for a decent, quality strap, but this strap definitely does not make the cut. Again, a bad strap is better than none at all, but do yourselves a favor if you are looking at buying this strap and spend a little bit more for a different brand.",

Best way I can explain it is that after you have twisted the cap on and sealed it, you have to then twist the pump handle in the opposite direction, which pops the pump handle up to pump, but then also unseals the cap. It needs some sort of mechanism to hold the sealed cap in place when attempting to pump. Other than that, it looks like it's a good quality pump -- the plastic bottle is heavy duty, the seals and tubing all look like they are really well-made etc, but ... that's all kinda pointless if you can't seal it shut.",

There were so many irrelevant characters being introduced, and then disappearing, never to be heard of again. And then there were so many incidents described that were just irrelevant to the story --silly narratives that I found inconsequential to the main action, which I knew quite well from the film. Lastly, the same characters were named in so many different ways, I found myself constantly confused. My favorite author is Trollope. He writes long novels, but all characters and all incidents are relevant and have meaning to the plot as a whole. Anyway ...

Anyway, I didn't notice any difference in taste and so I just went back to Morton's.\n\nWhat the heck, it's just a basic mineral with trace elements, they should have dried it out and ground it to a normal salt size.\n\nIt is cool that it's grey.",

At that point I realized that I had purchased a worthless Chapin product. Initially, I was hesitant to purchase the sprayer because the customer ratings seemed to be all over the place. That's usually a signal to me that quality control is a problem and my gut was telling me to buy something else.

I haven't seen any improvement yet aside from the money that I am missing.  I tried these cables and the THX certified monster cables with no observable effects whatsoever.\nPerhaps there is a noticeble difference between these and the dinky cables included with most DVD players (but the same can be said for the $20 cables that I was using).",

            "这样的全集买来就是为了收藏的。外包装完整的情况下，打开外壳变成了纸片。里面五本书三本书脊严重压损。套装里有个白色封面笔记本，蹭的全是黑油墨。最重要的是，收到书时，塑料就是撕开的，严重怀疑卖家是故意挑了残次品发来的。认为这么大一套书不会申请退换货。欺人太甚！",

It also was of poor quality it's construction, looked nothing like the filters which actually used to come from Honeywell and I am not even sure if it even worked. This is a very cheap aftermarket knock off and it's not worth your money. After having purchased this filter, and it failing on me within a month, I finally accepted the reality it was time to move on from this unit.\n\nThe whole stack two half filters, to get brand filters or shady aftermarket units - it's time to retire the unit now, sadly. It served me well. RIP my HEPA filter..."
