            "By the time I bought my Atari 2600 in 1984, Pac-Man had become the default game they bundled with the machine.  That was fine with me.  As with most anyone around at the time, I was a Pac-Man addict, and I wanted to get the game.  I'm not sure if they were including it because they knew everyone would want it or if it was because it was such a poor version of the arcade classic that no one was buying it.\n\nNow don't misunderstand me.  The basics of the game are the same as always.  You are the always hungry Pac-Man and you have to eat all the pellets in the maze while avoiding the ghosts who are out to eat you.  You get four power pills per level that, for a limited time, make the ghosts vulnerable so you can eat them.  Every time you clear a maze, you get a new one and an extra life, and the ghosts speed up a little.  There's even still a bonus item, only a vitamin pill, which appears for a little while.\n\nAtari was famous for the game variations that were included with many of the cartridges.  In this case, you can change the ghost speed from very slow to fast.  Pac-Man has a choice of two speeds, slow or fast.  In both cases, it is a subtle different at the beginning, but it seems to become greater the more levels you clear.  Additionally, you can use the \"difficulty switches\" on the back of the machine to determine how long the ghosts stay vulnerable after eating a power pill.\n\nYou can play the game by yourself or with a friend.  Just like the arcade, you take turns.\n\nSo far, it sounds pretty good, right?  So where's the problem?\n\nIs it with the graphics?  Well, they are certainly less than the arcade, but in keeping with the graphics on other Atari 2600 games.  The pellets and maze look fine, although the smaller squares making the ghosts and Pac-Man leave a little to be desired.\n\nHow about the sound?  A few of the sounds are similar to the arcade version, and some of them aren't.  The \"plink\" sound that comes from eating a pellet is almost laughable.  Again, it's not great but it's not the main issues.\n\nThe controls then?  Absolutely not.  The joystick works fabulously and the game responses quickly, moving you in all four directions.  The button does nothing during the game, although you can use it to start the new game.\n\nNo, the problems come from things that could have easily been avoided.  I get the feeling that they rushed this game through without giving it any thought to how fans of the arcade game would react.  For starters, the maze is completely different.  Plus the tunnels are at the top and bottom, not the sides.  The box that the ghosts start in and regenerate from has its opening on the side and not the top.\n\nWhile Pac-Man moves in all four directions and eats any pellet he touches, he only faces right or left.  And when he eats a ghost, he always stops for a second and faces to the right.\n\nThe ghosts aren't four different colors.  They are all one basic color.  And they get a little dimmer when you eat a power pill.  In fact, if it weren't for the music, it would be hard to tell when they go back to normal.\n\nThe entire game is pretty monochromatic.  As a kid, I thought it was because I was playing this on a black and white TV, but it hardly changed when I was finally able to upgrade to color.\n\nYou die when you come close to a ghost, meaning those last minute turns that work in the arcade don't work here.  On the plus side, you also eat a ghost if you get to close to him.\n\nI would be willing to excuse this as weaknesses of the Atari 2600 platform itself, but when they released Ms. Pac-Man, they took the time to correct many of these issues, so it was just laziness.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game is still fun.  But Pac-Man is much less than it should have been.  I suggest skipping this one and tracking down the much better Ms. Pac-Man cartridge instead.",

So it’s not always functional, and I ended up putting my cards in the front zipper pocket, which leaves me without a spot for my loose change, so that gets dumped in my bag.

The small states in the Gulf are either in alliance with America, or have American bases there, or both. You see America has to make sure it can get oil, and on favourable terms. Thats whats meant by controlling the oil. There is also the question of dollars vs euros. Thats a question I'll leave alone for the minute.

So because I should be wearing a smaller band, I ordered this in a 32D. Let me tell you... this bra had me squashed pretty flat. The band was fairly stretchy, although on the small size for a 32 (24.5\" unstretched, 29.5\" fully stretched). The cups were also a little bit on the small side, and were wider set (cup separation was 1.25\"). But the combination of everything had my breasts pretty well squashed, and there was noticeable quad-boob going on. It was definitely not what I would call \"one fabulous fit\". It looked awful on me. And if your breasts aren't wide set, this bra probably isn't for you. Otherwise, I'd say to definitely order a size larger than normal.\n\nAnd I also see widely varying reviews on the fit; same model number, but different purchase dates. This could imply that Maidenform has changed the fit while keeping the same model number. If that's the case, I'd be prepared to make returns because there's no way in knowing if what you're ordering is from old stock or new stock. And which stock it's from could make a huge difference in how it fits.",

            "Yes, that's not a typo.  Clancy has written a book with over 1,300 pages.  And so it should come as no surprise that I found the story slow. I mean, how many fast paced 1,300-paged books do you know of? And I do mean SLOW.  For those new to the Ryan story to date:  ex-CIA action hero turned cabinet  member turned VP is now president after the prior president is killed in a  suicide bombing run at the end of  Debt of Honor.  Not just the president,  but also just about every other high ranking politico in DC. (Is Clancy  hinting something here?).  Ryan becomes president and must show the  doubters (and those evil media types) that he is a big man and can do the  job.  Of course, Clancy tries not to stray from his reputation as a  techo-guru and so he includes discussions on the investigation into the  terrorist attack as well as a superficially indepth look at militia life (a  group of militia folk decide to go after the President).\nSince his early  stories, Ryan has become increasingly unlikeable as a character.  He will  occassionally spout off on rhetoric and make long-winded proclamations on  everything from the Russians, so-called \"liberals,\" femanists, to  the role of women and the media.  This books seems to read like Clancy's  own manifesto, a book where the author injects his own beliefs into the  main character without bothering to be objective.  People who disagree with  these views or Ryan are depicted as the bad guys.  Ryan, it seems, never  makes a mistake: he just has tough choices to make the results of which can  cause the loss of lives.\nClancy creates too many subplots and does  surprisingly short shrift with each of them.  This is strange after he has  spent hundreds of pages developing each subplot.  A story about a rival  politician is taken care of in quick order near the end of the book in a  nice, neat package.  Other subplots (a militia group and terrorist group  try to take advantage of the new president) also reach anticlimatic, and  unbelievable, conclusions. (i don't want to give a spoiler, but Ryan  actually orders a military operation to occur at the same time he is live  with a U.S. nation: kinda like a \"look, don't mess with us, we are  serious, see what we are doing right this very  second?\"\nUnfortunately, the long journey to the end of the book is  not worth it.  What Clancy needs is an editor, someone who will tell the  guy to cut down his writing.  To get on with it.  And to remember that what  made his earlier books popular was his plot and storylines.

When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry), we did not have \"proof of purchase\" and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.\n\nWe purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer \"service\" again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).\n\nIf we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service.",

            "There is nothing apparently wrong with this trailer hitch lock. The construction looks solid and easy to use. The problem is, it just doesn't come close to fitting our 2 5/16\" Airstream hitch. Even a call to the manufacturer took two days to get measurements, and we received measurements for a different part of the lock than those which we requested. With a 200 mile roundtrip drive to our travel trailer, this was a considerable inconvenience. The listing should be revised to include the maximum opening between the end of the locking shaft and the nearest edge of the ball--this measurement would let you determine in advance whether it would fit.\n\nWe started by purchasing MasterLock's \"universal\" Hitch lock, which was supposed to handle \"most\" 2 5/16\" hitches, but was way too small. With no measurements listed for either the \"universal\" or for the 378 2 5/16\" dedicated hitch lock, we extrapolated from the photos that the gap between the upright shaft retainer and the edge of the ball was significantly greater on the 378, so gave it a try. But they changed the construction to put a pin that limits the retraction of the shaft on the larger unit, so the effective opening looks to be exactly the same. Again, listing of this measurement for both hitches would save a lot of headache for consumers and all the companies involved, including shipping costs.",

Try one or all of those videos, and after you have learned the things you need to know to ENJOY and benefit from yoga, you can use Mr. Yee's videos for quick and refreshing yoga workouts when you are particularly pressed for time.  I'm sure Mr. Yee must be a very good yoga teacher in person, but he really cut corners in his videos, and if you are able to compare his videos with one or more of the videos mentioned above, you will surely see what I mean. In this video, and at least one of his other ones, I am sorry to say, he's basically on display with very little instruction.",

            "This game is very poorly programmed.  The judges make huge errors on the scoring and statistics.  The announcer makes incorrect comments during the fight.  The replays are completly the opposite of what the announcer is saying.  The game keeps saying it can not connect yet all other games and internet work fine.  There is no update system.  The menu system is very unintuitive and boring.  The music stinks unless you like rap.  The controller is very difficult to master or sometimes does not do what it is suppose to.  The load times are slow.  The game has crashed my system a few times.  I have still managed to have some fun so I gave it a very generous 3.  I could have given more details but with all these flaws it would have been extremely long winded.",

First off it is amazingly short, it took me one day to beat it, (and I was only playing it when the movie I was watching was on commercial). It consists of 12 \"levels\" where the only objective is to kill orcs, you cannot adjust your camera angle (which leads to very awkward battling), and you have to memorise complicated \"moves\" (for instance one was XXO^^R2) to even have a chance in Helm's Deep, They do let you change characters, however Aaragon is the only useful one (I tried the other 2, but then you have to memorise even more ridiculous moves)\nTo sum it all up, it is basicly short clips of the movie, where they let you play in a few scenes. The total game-play is 10 hours MAX I beat it in 6..\nI was truly disappointed in this game. However, it is worthy of renting for fans of the movie.",

That is what makes it so lovable. However, this game doesn't even try to catch your interest, or perhaps it tries too hard. Taking place between Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie, Gruntilda apparently sends her ghost to possess a robot and harasses Banjo and Kazooie. She kidnaps Kazooie and Banjo has to rescue his feathered buddy himself. Perhaps this is a pull at the heartstrings, separating Banjo and Kazooie, but without Kazooie's constant sarcasm, the story feels too dry.\nStory: 2/5\n\nGraphics are not too bad for Game Boy Advance.\nGraphics: 4/5\n\nSounds and music are fairly consistent with previous titles.\nSound: 4/5\n\nGameplay is where this game truly suffers. Unlike Tooie, previous abilities are absent. The lack of Kazooie makes much of the game feel slow. Worlds are very small and uninteresting. And then it's over before you know it. This game is incredibly short.\nGameplay: 1/5\n\nReplayability is very low. I have my doubts even the biggest Banjo Kazooie fan will play this one twice.\nReplay value: 1/5\n\nLast, the title is kid friendly, as are all Banjo Kazooie titles.\n\nOverall, this game does not do justice for the Banjo Kazooie name. If you're longing for another Banjo Kazooie game, do not look here, as this will just leave you wanting something more substantial. First timers should definitely avoid this one, as they will miss what makes Banjo Kazooie great.",

My husband (operates heavy equipment for a living and very strong) even had difficulty doing the lifting once they were filled with soil, both when they were installed and then again when they were taken down in October, with our first frost. If you are not strong enough to lift 50-100 lbs, don't purchase.

            "Ms Driscoll's novel was supposed to be about Waterloo, a British Military man, a woman disguised as a male physician. The premise itself is somewhat thin - a lady of quality disguises herself as a man to be a doctor.  As I began to read the story itself, I began to wonder if I was anywhere near a battlefield. Ms Driscoll gave us no sense of the place to inkling of the times. Her hero turns out to be a spy, and yes England had spies, but by the time the battle of Waterloo was engaged, the 95th Rifle Company was doing most of the scouting which is something quite different.\n\nThen there is Ms Driscoll's offhand remark that most of the nurses were prostitutes-- hummm.  Some were camp followers, yes, but many were also the wives of the common soldiers who fought there that day. Some of them were so near the battlefield with their children that they dashed out onto the battlefield in an attempt to pull their husband or common law husbands to safety after being wounded (this comes from eyewitnesses to the battle). Others were Officer's wives who came down the next morning from Brussels to look for their husbands.  And camp followers--official camp followers--were paid by the Army to wash and cook. The unofficial ones probably made a living selling their body among other services but there were not the only \"nurses\" at Waterlool\n\nThe immediate sexual encounter was rather over the top, given who this woman is supposed to be, but the author still gave me no sense of the place or time. I could have lifted her characters right out of the pages and slapped them into 1898 or 1920 or 1950 and it wouldn't have made a bit of difference. I probably would have found her female lead more believable if she had been born in 1986 and transported back in time to the battle, but then the book would have been fantasy and not historical fiction.\n\nAnd, finally, there's \"Scots Whiskey.\"  I serious doubt it was every referred to as \"Scots\" but I'm not prepared to research that so I'll  let it go, but I am darned certain that it has never been \"Whiskey.\"  \"Scots\" or Scotch - made exclusively in Scotland -- has always been Whisky -  please note there is no \"e\" in Whisky. Only Irish Whiskey gets the \"e\" and this was because of the way the tax laws were written. You can look it up.",

Naturally I rushed out to get the album and on my first listen I found the album to be weak, especially the fast tracks. Seven years later I re-bought the album and gave it another listen; as an adult I found the album to be stronger than I thought. Boyz II Men like Jodeci before them have always been the strongest with ballads and this is apparent on the singles Doin Just Fine,Never,4 Seasons Of Loneliness. Shawn's writing skills were apparent on the song Doin Just Fine which is one of the strongest songs on the album, however there's is a lot of weak material on the album. Songs such as Girl In The Life Magazine, Baby C'mon and To The Limit all seem forced and aren't song with that much heart. In my opinion truly evolved on their EXCELLENT fourth disc Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya.",

The plot was so convoluted and ridiculous that it was downright funny.

Still, that's funny!  If you like overacting, bad dialogue, terrible plotting, over the top melodrama, you will love this movie.  I simply laughed the whole way through, and as I said, where else can you find a character actually spewing the word, \"Supercilious?\"  The unintended fun brought this movie up from one star to two!",

            "The Professor's Assassin by Matthew Pearl is a prequel short story to his new novel, The Technologists.\n\nThe main character of The Professor's Assassin is not the assassin. It's the man who finds him. Which is an excellent thing, because William Barton Rogers is a much more fascinating character.\n\nRogers is a professor of the practical sciences. At the still relatively young University of Virginia, he is the professor of practical science.\n\nIn 1840, the University of Virginia was plagued by student protests and campus riots. The more hotheaded among the student body were violently petitioning for the right to bear arms on campus.\n\nThe violence escalated to frenzies of drunken rock-throwing at faculty housing. Of course, the rioters were always masked and hooded before they started drinking and beating on the walls of the houses with clubs, so no one could be identified in the morning.\n\nOne night, Rogers decided he'd had enough. He went out to confront the rioters. He confronted the leader face to face. Or face to mask. The young man threatened Rogers repeatedly, asking him how he dared to challenge the \"University Volunteers\". Rogers walked away, daring the man to shoot him in the back, not certain that he wouldn't, scared that the young man would and knowing, certain that if he wavered in the assuredness of his strike for one instant, the man would bring him down.\n\nThe next morning the President of the University was found shot outside of his home. Although President Davis knows who shot him, he refuses to name his assailant. A few days later he dies of his wound.\n\nRogers is a man of science. He also feels compelled to find justice for his friend and colleague.\n\nAs Rogers works through the case he feels he must solve, and the reasons why he must solve it, he finds himself dealing with the differences between his own practical methods, and the more philosophical minds of his peers.\n\nIt is as he works through his solution for this case that the germ of the idea for MIT is born.\n\nEscape Rating B: This was a good introduction for The Technologists, and the story holds up on its own merits. The notes in the back are a must-read, because they explain how the author used the documentation of the real case to build the story. The story is closely based on a historic event. Davis was assassinated, and he did refuse to name his killer. A good bit of the rest is storyteller's license, but Pearl used that license well.",

For thicker oils it would be perfect.\n\nThe bottle is 2 7/8\" from base to tip of plastic cap; the needle is about 1 1/8\" long, for an overall height of about 4 1/8\".  The bottle is 1 1/4\" wide.

            "I have always used the plain ring markers for my knitting.  These lock ring markers are much better.  For one thing, to use a ring marker you have to knit to the spot where you want to place one so you can slip it on the needle.  There is no way to apply a ring marker to the part of the knitting that is not still on the needles.  These markers you can put anywhere, any time.  You just open one up, put it on the needle or on the knitting itself, and then close it.  If you've ever knitted past the point where you were supposed to put a marker, you know what a benefit this is.  Now that I've tried them, I wouldn't go back to the rings.  The one thing I would change about them is to make them a little less flimsy without compromising their light weight.",

If you want to see acting, then watch the powerhouses  Humphrey Bogart or Jack Nicholson, but not Seagal, the seventh dan black  belt aikidoist. His films are primarily made to thrill and entertain. With  his erect posture, powerful build and frowning expression, he exerts an  intimidating screen presence. Like a tornado sweeping across the torrid  zone, he leaves the bad guys annihilated and in brief, hard-trimmed action  scenes, he despatches villain after villain with either a bullet to the  head, a chop to the throat, a thrust with a knife or a kick to the face. In  this film at least, he also manages to be mildly humorous and even  self-deprecating in his portrayal of a bead-wearing Buddhist cop. This is  the first film in which he actually draws blood during a conflict with a  bad guy. The action scenes are supreme. The dialogue is post-Tarantino tart  and the film, as a whole, is wonderfully self-mocking.",

            "This album is the Bob Marley version of The Beatles '1s' CD. It doesn't by any means represent the whole of his output or his musical and ideological viewpoint, just as The Beatles '1s' CD, with nothing from 'Sergeant Pepper' or the second side of 'Abbey Road', by no means gives an overview of The Beatles career. Marley had much to say in his music and only a small fraction of it is here.\n\nNevertheless, just as '1s' is a wonderful set of Beatles' songs, so 'Legend' is an amazing collection of Marley's most commercial work. He had a gift of writing tuneful, entertaining reggae that no-one else has come close to matching. Even those who are not already fans will find that they know many of these tunes, so often have they been played on the radio or at parties, not to mention been covered by other (lesser) artists. They're lightweight but brilliant popular music from a man bursting with talent.\n\nIf you use this CD to launch yourself into an examination of Marley's other work, and the social and political messages he imparted, then great. I have many CDs of Marley showing his complex and introspective side, his anger and frustration and compassion. They are all terrific and well worth the effort of getting to know, even if not as accessible as this CD.\n\nIf this turns out to be the only CD of Bob's that you buy, then you have still got some fantastic music from a man who was one of the greatest ever popular musicians not only of the Caribbean but of the world.",

            "Where The Farseer began as a somewhat formulaic fantasy trilogy Hobb has stretched the tale in to new directions and broken new ground. It is tremendously refreshing to read a series unabashedly trditionally heroic and romantic (in the chivalric sense)  yet has a storyline that goes in new directions. We have a protagonist in Fitz who fully matures as an adult and must deal with adult themes. We have a war where the economic and psychological damage is as compelling as the carnage. We have battles that take place remotely and in a guerilla fashion without the trope of mighty sieges and liberated cities. Hobb has certainly worked from a traditional genre and borrowed from former authors but it is also the case that her work has introduced themes of heroic sacrifice and political turmoil that have not been fully explored before. She has opened new ground for future authors and by our standard where we rate books by their effect on future authors (c.f., Harold Bloom's Anxiety of Influence) we feel her work can stand up under any criticism favorably. There is no question that future protagonists will have to stand up to Fitz as an example of the genre's most perfectly crafted hero.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ\n\nAs in any highly regarded and very good series of books, readers of the prior books who have enjoyed Hobb so much will have bought and read Assassin's Quest before they've bothered to read any review of it. By these people, we believe that Quest will probably be regarded as the best of the three books. We also feel that this book could probably stand on its own and read in isolation. As with any third novel in a trilogy, loss of the background will result in many of the nuances of the work lost on the reader (certainly the romance between Molly and Fitz will be incomprehensible) yet it does not crucially depend upon the prior books. In a refreshing change, Hobb has written three books that work tremendously well in concert with each other but whose movements can also stand on its own. Readers who would like to explore this work need not necessarily read them in order. As a final credit to Hobb, this is an excellent book with which to introduce readers who are unfamiliar with the fantasy genre and do not believe there are any worthwhile publications within it; The Farseer Trilogy is a direct rebuttal. These books remain an excellent choice for younger (teenage) readers.\n\nWHO SHOULD AVOID\n\nQuest is the longest book in the offering and those readers who have been very impatient with Fitz's caviling about his responsibilities will be rather disappointed with the first third of the book (as we were to a certain extent). We don't think the book should be avoided but certainly there will be some people who will turn away. Fans of the huge, large-scale battles that have been rendered so well in Return of the King, A Clash of Kings, and The Gates of Fire will not find that sort of display here. The Farseer Trilogy has never been about these enormous wars and epochal battles. We think these people should expand their horizons a bit but also recognize that sometimes people crave the familiar and predictable. If that means big battle scenes, this book should probably be saved for later. If you get embarrassed about cheesy cover art (because of the cover of this book is C H E E Z - Z E E E ), you'll have to read it with a paper bag cover.\n[...]",

            "My Soul To Lose is a prequel novella to Rachel Vincent's popular series, Soul Screamers, which I have yet to read! While I think it probably isn't absolutely necessary to read this novella before the rest of the series, I found it to be a lovely introduction to the world and characters. It left me with a huge urge to read the first book which hopefully I'll get to do really soon! Sometimes novellas can be lacking in substance or feel like they were cut short but this one certainly wasn't.\n\nThe story starts off with a bang. Kaylee Cavanaugh is trying to enjoy a day out with a friend but her 'panic attacks' are getting in the way of that. Kaylee's really having a tough time of it. She screams for no apparent reason and there's nothing she can do about it! Fearing she is mentally ill, she is admitted to a psychiatric unit and even had to be sedated for 15 hours. This story mostly takes place inside the unit. I've read a fair few books that feature psychiatric hospitals and I think of all of them, this one was the easiest to picture.\n\nRachel Vincent's writing is just amazing! I could see everything clearly in my head and there was so much emotion throughout the story it was almost tangible. When Kaylee was having one of her attacks, it was described so well you could almost feel it yourself. You could sense her panic, fear and confusion. It really gets inside your head and makes you realize what Kaylee is going through. I just loved how real it all felt even if the circumstances and reasons behind it were a little surreal!\n\nThis is definitely one to read in a single sitting. I was so captivated by the story, I couldn't tear my eyes away from Kindle. I loved the ideas, the mystery and the characters. Kaylee is a likable person and I'm looking forward to getting to know her better in the next book. If you want to test this series out, this novella is really a good way to do so! It will leave you hungry for more. I have a feeling I'm going to adore book one!",

            "I have the April Aire humidifier model 560, so that was on the list and I knew this would fit.  It's been out of action for a while, and I've been too lazy to fix it.  I didn't realize this was one of the main components and relatively easy to replace.  The fittings that came with it worked well with what I had.  I cut the water valve and removed the old one, it was fouled with calcium, under most circumstance I'd have soaked it in some Lime a way, but replacing it was better.  The bolt pattern on this was perfect, and the thing is on the outside of the unit, with twist connectors for the wires.  After cutting the circuit breaker for this, I removed the old one and attached the new.  It mostly stayed in place with the metal water lines, but I bolted it back down anyway.\n\nPerformance, it's been a few years since my humidifier system worked and when I wear my retainers, I often get some nasty dry mouth, and dry eyes in the morning.  I put the humidifier on about 25 percent and let it run, this morning I could tell the difference, wearing my retainers to bed, I barely felt dry mouth at all when I woke.  I had a cheap wood veneer serving table split on me last year cause it was too near, the heat output vent.  I think I can relax now that this is running again, and didn't know it was really this easy to fix.\n\nThe fittings worked, but I did fish around to find some pipe sealant, I noticed that on the old unit (which made it a bit of a pain to remove, but it's a good idea, you want your water lines well sealed near the furnace controls.  I had to have relays replaced on the furnace a few years back when it was getting a lot of water from AC condensation dropping in the circuit board off the pipes.  Measure your fitting sizes and get the right connections before you start, and I recommend a small metal can of pipe sealant.  This is a good website to help with installation, they do a step by step install:  http://www.livestrong.com/article/206826-how-to-repair-an-aprilaire-humidifier-water-solenoid-valve/  It's pretty close to what I did, except I used the sealant so I didn't get leaks.  The site recommends you use a wiring professional, but if you know the power is dead, and you can test it with a meter before you start, it doesn't take an electrician to twist a pair of wires, just make sure you have the ground one correct, mark it before you start.\n\nRecommended, easy to install, fits many standard humidifiers, if only other things were so easy.  I have a toilet issue right now the exotic mechanism broke and I have to manually use the valve to fill it.  Plumbers cost a ton, and If this was not so exotic, I'd replace it with a simple float ball and rubber flap mechanism, it seems the fancy ones break about every two years.  If this were as easy to fix as this unit, I'd have done it already.  Device looks to be solid high quality brass, you wouldn't expect it to rust, but eventually it will get full up with calcium and need replacing again, but like the first time it will not be a problem.",

I say without embellishment that this is the sharpest non-surgical edge I have ever felt when out of the box. It's frightening! I doesn't so much cut as it splits atoms. A few weeks of hard work into it and the edge is well retained. Just maintain it as you should and it'll last for many years to come.",
            "Even tho it was way too short it was so cute and romantic hope she's writing a second book because the first was too good and needs a better ending than that!!",
            "It wasn't quite the massacre I was expecting.\n\nGiven the levels of brutality we had experienced in earlier books (some warranted, some not so much) I fully anticipated the series to climax in a grand orgy of violence the likes of which we had never even imagined.  Strangely though, what we get is almost calm in a way.\n\nFor those who have been following along, all the threads finally come to a head, as the ship containing Morn and Davies and Angus and company finally reaches Earth, having picked up a few more people along the way, just in time to realize that the Amnion have arrived there ahead of them and ready to shoot anything that won't agree to their terms.  Meanwhile Warden Dios and his various directors attempt to pull all the pieces together of their plan to take down UMC CEO Holt Fasner and release the grip that he has on humanity.\n\nPretty much if you made it this far, the last volume gives you more of what you might expect.  There's no dip in quality but things don't get remarkably better either.  Donaldson writes suspenseful space situations quite well and for the most part the constant shifting back and forth between perspectives helps bring the pacing to something resembling a fever pitch.  The thing is, the main characters still aren't that interesting.  What I found fascinating was how much more interesting everyone else other than Morn and Angus and Davies was, where I wanted to read more about what was going on with Dios and his directors and all the political maneuvering, as opposed to Morn once again being all angsty or Donaldson's continuing attempts to redeem Angus as some kind of hero.  Reading about Min Donner holding down the fort on the ship both against Morn's band of misfits and stalling for time against the council winds up being a far more interesting experience, topped only by Hashi Lebwohl struggling to find evidence to connect the kaze attacks with Holt Fasner's orders.  Lebwohl winds up being the breakout character in the series to me, starting out as someone who was being sneaky for the sake of being sneaky and turning into a morally ambiguous man in service to the truth and acting on it because he respects Warden Dios so much.\n\nAnd it is the politics that make the series only because it makes the stakes seem so much higher.  Donaldson does manage to give a visceral thrill to scenes of the council arguing, with the directors stalling for time and holding off the attempts by Fasner's puppets to hijack the whole affair, and when the victory does come down it not only feels earned but feels earned through a team effort, as opposed to one person being heroic.  In comparison the scenes in space just pale, with the Amnion threatening without actually doing anything beyond that (at least nothing that can't be undone easily . . . and it is mildly disappointing that for all the fear about being mutated, we just see one person turned into an Amnion in the entire series) and everyone working through their various issues ad nauseum until you're just begging for something to blow up.\n\nWhich ultimately remains a problem that the series just can't overcome, exciting as it is.  Don't get me wrong, it's a pageturner watching all the various plottings come together, but there's really nothing in here that will stick and move the soul the way the best epics do.  The threat of Holt Fasner never seems to be as frightening or massively monstrous as the other characters seem to believe (he screams a lot and is clearly mean, but otherwise seems like a general megalomaniac with mortality issues) and thus it becomes hard to believe that all the brutality and death over the last five books was warranted or justified (in Warden Dios' defense, he does admit the situation got a bit away from him) so it winds up being a lot of fuss for very little reason.  The Amnion wind up being a much more frightening threat in theory but it turns out that their bag of tricks is fairly limited and once they run through those they don't have much else.  You reach a point about halfway through the book where it seems obvious that the good guys are going to win, it just becomes a matter of how and who is going to survive.  And the answer, surprisingly, is \"nearly everyone\".\n\nThe book is also hamstrung by the problem from the last novel, where the multiple viewpoints require characters to repeat information that we just learned from the last chapter . . . good, if you're reading the book over a long period of time and need to be reminded about what happened, bad otherwise.  In fact it sucks a little bit of the suspense out of the climaxes as events have been put into motion for so long that watching them unfold is just a matter of seeing things done in the right order.\n\nBut its the repetition in general that sinks the series a few notches below \"classic\" and into \"merely good\", as I said earlier, the characters tend have their pet issues and those often get repeated in lieu of actual characterization.  Thus five books in we're still getting Angus moping over the fact that he was tortured as a child (for what reason? who knows?), Morn angsting over pretty much everything (her family dying, Angus, you name it) and that's not even counting the various illegals and minor characters who get the same treatment.  There's a stock sense that they don't get developed past a certain point unless the plot requires it, until the plot is over and it doesn't really need them anymore.  Morn's struggles and losses don't come across as deeply felt where I'm actively rooting for her, nor is she so dynamic that it's believable that Angus would start to change his personality because she was nice to him.  It doesn't sink the series as far as I originally expected it would, mostly because the plotting and the political stuff livens up the action, but the series ultimately remains an exciting if somewhat empty experience in being epic and proving that doing the right thing is a good idea, where the stakes don't truly seem to justify the means.  It's telling that after spending five books and thousands of pages with them, the characters are comfortable to me, but never become anything more than slightly familiar strangers.  Its clever in its construction but all the structuring and allusions seems to have lost sight of where the heart should go.",

            "Director Brian Henson presides over this delightful 1992 retelling of the Charles Dickens classic--the first Muppet movie since the passing of his father, Muppets creator, Jim Henson two years earlier.\n  I've thought of how, in childhood I fantasized about all my favorite characters merging under Disney's auspices, and found my self amusingly satisfied at that concept becoming a reality.\n  Here, we see our favorite Muppet characters decked out in Victorian garb as Paul Williams' spry score contributes to the bustling Christmastide atmosphere.\n  We find The Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens(Dave Goelz) hawking fruit with Rizzo the Rat( Steve Whitmire) in 1840s London as the former begins his narration.\n  Soon, the lively atmosphere darkens as the central figure of this tale rounds a corner en route to his office.\n  As Ebenezer Scrooge,Oscar winner Michael Caine clearly enjoys his interaction with the felt figures, and  there are many comical, warm, grim and tragic moments to relive on the miserly moneylender's road to redemption.\n  Kermit the Frog (Whitmire) is Scrooge's loyal clerk, who whose fellow clerks are rats. Steven Mackintosh plays Scrooge's nephew, Fred, who invites his stiffly reluctant uncle to dine with him, and sees the first moments of Scrooge's  meeting with the charity organizers, played by Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker(Goetz and Whitmire), but leaves before its unpleasant ending.\n  The office's atmosphere changes after Scrooge departs, leaving his employees to close shop and go home for Christmas.\n  At his own house, Scrooge is confronted by the ghosts of his deceased partners, Jacob Marley and  his brother Robert(Goelz and Jerry Nelson), the latter of whom was added  so Statler and Waldorf could have some screen time, who warn him to change his ways, and that he will be visited by three spirits.\n  The first of these is an ethereal child(Jessica Fox, Robert Tygner), who takes Scrooge to revisit his past and shows him his younger self (Raymond Coulthard, Russell Martin, Theo Sanders, Kristopher Milnes, Edward Sanders), as the twig was bent, but omits any mention of his unhappy family life, and his reunion with his sister, Fan.\n  Instead we see the influence of his headmaster Sam the Eagle(Frank Oz) on his behavior, and as a young businessman(Coulthard), we see how he is too caught up in worrying about expenses to enjoy the Fozziwig's(Oz and Nelson) Christmas Party, presided over by Animal(Oz) and bandmates.\n But he meets a lovely young woman named Belle(Meredith Braun), and then we see how a promising relationship fizzles because she realizes that money will always be more important to Scrooge than love, and she does not have a lifetime to wait for him to change. The song, \"When Love is Gone\" has been cut from the DVD and televised releases.\n  A pained Scrooge, left to grieve over past mistakes, encounters the Ghost of Christmas Present(Don Austen) shortly thereafter. Escorted out into the  world amid the glorious Christmas hubbub, his spirits lift for a while as he sees people enjoying themselves, but then feels alienated as he watches his nephew, Fred, and niece, Clara( an perpetually smiling Robin Weaver, who is probably the most accurate looking of all the actresses who have played Fred's wife) playing a parlor game with friends, and finds the joke to be at his expense.\n  Then he his shown his clerk, Bob Cratchit's house where Miss Piggy's(Oz) Mrs. Cratchit is preparing the meager feast with help from her son, Peter(David Rudman) as Bob returns from church with ailing son, Tiny Tim(Nelson) in tow.\n  Scrooge learns the direness of their predicament and sees Mrs. Cratchit's ire at his insensitivity towards the suffering of others.\n  Soon it is time for the jovial giant to leave Scrooge's side, and make way for the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come(Don Austen, Robert Tygner).\n  The most grim of the three spirits frightens both Rizzo and Dickens to the point where they duck into a church as the last part of the tale unfolds.\n  A business associate of Scrooge(Whitmire)  is seen discussing the death of an unknown businessman, whose possessions end up in the unseemly custody of the tarantula, Old Joe(Rudman) a rag and bone collector.\n Soon he revisits the Cratchit House, whose atmosphere is now more solemn, and Scrooge learns what his own fate will soon be.\n  A contrite Scrooge awakens and hastily begins to amend his ways and amid a tuneful outcome, reconciles with those whom he neglected or rejected just a day earlier.\n  This smash hit  is a great way to introduce the very young  to the Dickens classic, and it must have left initial viewers with the satisfaction that Jim Henson's legacy was in excellent hands.",

            "It is all in the screen. If you read the other reviews, you can see that people are bitterly divided over the screen on this new Palm.  Honestly, I was disappointed when I first saw it.  It appeared dim and if you don't look at it straight on, the colors are washed out.  However, having used it for a week or so now, I've adjusted to it.  Now that I know the angle to hold it at, the screen looks great. It has an energy saving mode, but this is too dim for all but brightly lit environments.\nCompare the M505 side-by-side with the Palm IIIC and there is no comparison.  The IIIC screen is much brighter and easier to see.  Although the IIIC only has 256 colors and the M505 is claimed to have over 65 thousand colors, you won't notice it when you directly compare them.  Palm claims that the M505 has a screen that is easier to use in direct sunlight.  I have to take their word for it because I work indoors and can't imagine ever using my Palm in direct sunlight.  If you a lifeguard or work at the beach, this is definitely the Palm for you!\nThe unit is smaller than the IIIC and fits more comfortably in the pocket. The memory is expandable which is a major advantage over the IIIC.  And gone are those incredibly annoying and unreliable batteries.  The unit has rechargeable batteries and it charges up whenever it is in the cradle. I don't know how long the batteries last, but it easily lasts the day.  I recharge mine every night.\nOverall, this is a nice palm. I bought it the day it came out, based upon its tremendous prerelease press.  That only goes to show that you can't trust the reviews and, perhaps, that you should look before you leap.  Honestly, I wouldn't trust this review either.  Although I've adjusted to the Palm M505 and I'm happy with it, I'd advise anybody contemplating its purchase to compare it directly with the Palm IIIC and whatever other color handheld you may be considering.  You need to compare the screens directly and decide for yourself.",

On more than one occasion, I grabbed an awl, without careful attention, only to poke the sharp point of the awl into a finger followed by a few choice words.  I scanned the Amazon site and settled on these.  An excellent choice.  The swiftly shipped Clover Point Protectors fit perfectly over the sharp points of the awls, protecting a (maybe not so) handy man from unfortunate experiences.

It may seem incredible and almost unbelievable, but if you happen to read true accounts by other Holocaust survivors, you will find that the incredible and miraculous plays a significant role in saving these victims of Nazi propaganda from certain death.

            "These pickups sound great.  I love the neck and middle.  All three sound distinct and have their own character.  I have a 1994 Fender Standard Stratocaster (Mexican) and the stock pickups sounded ok, but this is a big improvement.  I can go from nice clear blossoming cleans to distorted snarling tones that I didn't think my guitar could do.  All of the tone and volume knobs on the guitar and on the amp now seem to be doing a lot more, and many more tones are available.\n\nThe bridge is still a bit ice-picky for my taste but nothing like what it used to be.  Other than that I have no complaints as far as tone.  The two and four positions quack and sound great.  The pickups are well-balanced and all the strings sound well.\n\nMy complaints are that the wax potting seemed kind of sloppy.  The screw holes were filled with wax, except for one where it wasn't and half the pickup was incompletely put into the wax.  The screws are self-tapping and a pain in the neck to get to engage into the holes.  The pickups don't want to mount straight, and my neck pickup is at a slight off angle (no effect on sound).  The pickup covers fit poorly and feel flimsy.  The thin pickup wire runs right underneath them and it seems like it could be damaged by the sharp edge of the pickup cover.  I was holding my breath while mounting them and I hope I never have to take them out of the guitar.\n\nI was expecting a little more elegant craftsmanship out of such expensive pickups but I'm not outrageously disappointed, like I would be if they didn't sound so good.",

            "First published in 1939, A Coffin for Dimitrios is widely regarded as one of the best spy novels ever written. That reputation is richly deserved. But it would be a mistake to pigeonhole what may be Eric Amblers most accomplished work as merely an espionage novel, as it features few of the familiar devices of that genre  which may be why its so highly regarded. However, A Coffin for Dimitrios can be best seen as an historical novel that depicts Europe between the two World Wars, and does so masterfully.\n\nThe novel is structured as an account of a wide-ranging investigation into the life and death of a notorious international criminal named Dimitrios Makropoulos. After surviving one of the gruesome massacres of Armenians and Greeks undertaken by Kemal Ataturk, the legendary founder of modern Turkey, Makropoulos is said to have participated in assassination plots in at least two countries, engaged in espionage as a freelance agent, and murdered several men. The unlikely investigator is Charles Latimer, a lecturer in political economy at a minor English university who has left behind the academic life and become a successful author of formulaic detective novels.\n\nIn Istanbul on a trip to research a forthcoming novel, Latimer stumbles across the head of the Turkish secret police at a party. The two hit it off, and the policeman, apparently showing off to an author he admires, introduces the novelist to the secret Turkish files on Makropoulos. He even takes him to view the mans body in the morgue. Out of fascination with the criminals remarkable story and caught up now in an obsession, Latimer halts work on a novel and sets out to investigate Makropoulos life, traveling from Turkey to Greece, Bulgaria, Switzerland, and France as clues turn up in unlikely places.\n\nAs Latimers obsessive quest proceeds, his views of Makropoulos become more nuanced. To the novelist, it was useless to try to explain him in terms of Good and Evil. They were no more than baroque abstractions. Good Business and Bad Business were the elements of the new theology. Dimitrios was not evil. He was logical and consistent; as logical and consistent in the European jungle as the poison gas called Lewisite [developed in the US following World War I] and the shattered bodies of children killed in the bombardment of an open town. To judge from both the histories and the literature of the era, this sentiment aptly reflects the pessimism pervading Europe during in the 1920s and 30s.\n\nFor anyone who fancies historical fiction, detective fiction, or espionage novels, A Coffin for Dimitrios will be a delight.",

Rush is an interesting and unusual band. They've been together for 3 decades and the quality of their newer music seems to get musically lyrically and rhythmically better on average with each decade, though not with each and every album. They've released so much work, that some \"perspective\" might be helpful. This particular album (Grace Under Pressure, 1984, 4.0 stars) marked a big turning point in their work at which I really began to enjoy and respect Rush, though I was quite familiar their earlier work as it was being released back in the 70's. In retrospect, their upward trend started in 1982 with:\n\nSignals  (1982) ~3.3 stars\n\nGrace Under Pressure  ~4.0 stars\n\nPower Windows  (1985) ~3.8 stars, nearly as good as Grace Under Pressure.\n\nHold Your Fire (1987) ~3.7 stars,\n\nCheck out their more recent work too,\n\nRoll The Bones (1991) ~3.4 stars,\n\nCounterParts  (1993) ~4.2 stars, <==I recommend Counterparts.\n\nTest For Echo  (1996) ~3.4 stars,\n\nVapor Trails  (2002) ~4.5 stars. <==WOW! RUSH's best album?\n\n[In general with the older CDs, pay attention to re-mastered vs original release, make sure which alternative sounds better to you.]\n\nI rate on an absolute scale, so 4 out of 5 rating is really enjoyable music.

No spoilers here about whether she lives or dies, and what she learns about herself and the people she loves while she floats beneath the ice of that winter-cold lake. But her journey is beautiful and moving, filled with the sort of emotion that makes a reader's heart swell until it hurts. Don't read this book if you're interested in facts.

            "This was another great addition to an amazing series, but its biggest fault is that it really just set up the next two books. While I loved the adventuring featured in this book, in the end, nothing really happened, there were no changes. My other problem with this book and all of his books is how he switches the point of view every chapter among multiple different characters. Each one is written very well, but the tone shifts with each character, and I end up reading the book chapter by chapter. I couldn't put the book down until I finished reading the chapter, but once it was over I had no desire to read what came next right away, unless it was one of my favorite characters. I also didn't like Jon Snows role in this book, he used to be one of my favorite characters, but in this one he was really bogged down by running the wall. Once again, in this book there were multiple main character deaths, which I find frustrating. Along with cliffhanger probably deaths, which if the people are actually dead I would be very upset and annoyed. It's nice to know that the characters are vulnerable, their victory isn't guaranteed, but I would still like for my favorite characters to win some of the time.\n\nMy biggest fear with this series is that Martin might die before he finishes it. I don't mean any offense, but he doesn't look too healthy, and I doubt you could get someone to finish the series successfully. The fantasy world was lucky when Brandon Sanderson took over for Robert Jordan, I don't know if they'd be that lucky a second time. I hope that it won't take another 5 years to write each book, because he would then be 73, which is pushing it even for a healthy man.

            "\"No one stays forever,\" reads the first line of Emily St. John Mandel's debut novel Last Night in Montreal. Certainly Mandel's main character can't stay in one place for longer than a few months, if that. Abducted when she was seven by her non-custodial parent, Lilia spent her childhood in a car--nine years of motels and chain restaurants and public parks, dyed hair and name changes, her picture and her grieving mother on their room's flickering TV screen before they fled again in the middle of the night. The book slowly circles around Lilia's story until we get the whole of it, skipping around in time and among perspectives: Lilia's own, when she was younger; and later we see her mostly through other's eyes--the private detective who became obsessed with her case, his daughter, and Eli, the latest of her abandoned lovers.\n\nLast Night in Montreal is a powerful read--an unusual story, very well told. It's also dispiriting, not only because of the facts of Lilia's life, but because the principals of Mandel's story are all rootless and unsatisfied. But it's a compulsively readable book. I downed it in two days and might have been quicker if the obligations of my own rooted existence hadn't interfered. In the end I did have problems with the story's credibility. Mostly I find it hard to believe that the private detective on Lilia's tail would abandon his life in order to track her down, that he would continue tracking her after he found her. But the book raises any number of interesting questions, among them the reasons for this obsession of his, which leads him to treat his own daughter more horribly than the kidnapper he's chasing treats Lilia. I also am not sure that it made sense to make the private detective and his wife former circus people, but perhaps I'm missing some thematic relevance here. That the book raises so many questions would make it a good selection for book discussion groups. And maybe for Oprah as well, if she's reading this. (And I know you are, Oprah. I know you are.)\n\n-- Debra Hamel",

The PH+ is potent, but not nearly as much.\n\nThe kit for testing is wonderful, but beware using as the sole testing procedure if you are color blind. The green/greenish brown area is difficult to decipher, but as someone else said, if you see it turn green when first dropped in, then turn to the brownish yellow.. you can guess that it will be in the 6.5 range. If there's no green initially, it's acidic and most likely in the 5-5.5 range.\n\nAs with temp guns and other testing equipment, I soon went crazy treating everything in sight.",

            "Bought this to solve a shortage of outlets for my wife's sewing table. With lights, laptop, sewing machines, sergers, etc., her sewing room had become a jungle of extension cords and plug strips.\n\nWorks as advertised.  Only problem was it arrived without the wall mounting clips mentioned in the user instructions.  Called Tripp Lite customer service and they shipped me a new mounting kit.  Arrived about 10 days later.\n\nInstall took about an hour total.  After locating 4 wall studs, I used the plug strip itself as a ruler, along with a level,  to draw a line on the wall, and used the provided screws to screw the 4 mounting clips to the wall.  Still had a bit of a problem with the exact alignment of the clips, which is crucial to getting them to work, til I once again used the plug strip like a ruler.  I held it to the wall again and loosened the two outside clips, allowing them to drop a bit, but more importantly, true themselves up with the plug strip.  I then tightened these clips again, pressed the plug strip against them as a reference, and did the same trick with the two remaining clips.  With a bit of force, the plug strip snapped securely into all 4 clips, and it was done.\n\nA huge improvement.  No way we'll ever fill up all 20 outlets, but having spares is reassuring.",

            "There is a soulfulness to Alex Clare's voice that cannot be ignored.  In fact, when I first heard `Too Close' I actually thought it was James Morrison trying his hand at a more rock centered sound.  Yes, Alex Clare delivers some depth to the proceedings by allowing a grovel and an honesty pierce his music.  It isn't always enough to keep the album relevant, but for the most part `The Lateness of the Hour' proves to be a worthwhile endeavor for both Clare and us.\n\nWhile `Too Close' certainly got our attention, it is in the softer, quieter moments that this album truly shines.  Songs like `Relax My Beloved' and `Whispering' allow Clare to develop a deeper sound and more personal connection through the subtle music and his entrancing tone.  Songs like `Up All Night' and `Humming Bird' develop the rock sound Clare is trying to establish (a notch below `Too Close' with catchier elements) and they prove successful as a whole.  `Hands Are Clever' breaks up what feels like an almost too routine sound with some jazzy Southern charm.  But there is where my main complaint for this album lies; it does sound very `matchy matchy'.  The album sounds so `put together' with almost every track leading into the next with a sound that is very similar.  While I understand that this can be a plus (at least it doesn't feel disjointed) it can also lead to a feeling of monotony.  It doesn't help that some songs, namely `Tightrope', feel devoid of life.\n\nStill, the highs here are worthy of note and really, Alex Clare does offer something interesting to modern music.  His vocals have a very aged soulful sound, and his musical direction has a very modern progressive pop rock sound, so marrying the two together can produce something interesting.  I look forward to where his career takes him.  Despite some aforementioned issues (and the way he says `Sanctuary') I actually like this album, at least in parts, and recommend taking a peak!",

            "I'm a big fan of Eckhart Tolle and became aware of \"Awareness\" by word of mouth from other Tolle fans.  I couldn't put the book down; read it in one sitting.  As I was reading, I tripped out that the author was actually a priest!  His style of writing is straight to the point, \"in your face.\"  Picture a highly energetic motivational speaker who genuinely wants you to change for the better; well that's what I pictured.  He speaks the truth bluntly.  It'll open your eyes, make you see things from a totally new angle.\n\nAlthough I love Tolle's \"The Power of Now,\" for someone who's new to this, I would recommend reading \"Awareness\" first because it's much easier to understand.  I had to read Tolle's books a few times before I really had an understanding.  And if you're already familiar and enjoyed Tolle's works, you will surely enjoy this.  \"Awareness\" covers a lot of material that Tolle goes over: disidentifying with thoughts, labeling, presence (not covered in depth like Tolle though), and more.  But Anthony covers the material in a different, more down-to-earth type style.  If you had trouble understanding Tolle, \"Awareness\" could probably help you have a better understanding.\n\nYou can easily find live recordings online of Anthony speaking to an audience.  He's not highly energetic as I had in mind, but he doesn't need to be.  There's surely some magical quality when Anthony speaks.  If you check out the audience, you'll notice that they are all giving Anthony their full undivided attention.  They're transfixed, hanging on his every word.  \"Awareness\" is actually a transcription of his live talks.  Just like how the audience is transfixed seeing Anthony live, you too will be transfixed reading the words just like how I was.  Amazing read!",

            "This IR thermometer seems to use similar modules as more expensive brands. It could be a copy or an OEM version of many branded models, its commonly listed as the DT-380 or DT8380 Infrared Thermometer.  For $12, its a steal if you know more about how to work it properly, and it works wonderfully.\n\nDigital Thermometer 8:1 distance:spot ratio for 380C decodes the model number.\n\nI tracked a similar looking manual and nearly identical device to a Chinese factory, See comments.\n\nThe manual is nearly identical to the model I received.  I can't disassemble the unit to check the PCB and makers mark since part of the unit is glued.\n\nIR thermometers are calibrated against dark or black bodies, and perform worst with reflective surfaces like stainless steel, foil, or mirrors.  For best results, point to dark to black surfaces.\n\nI tested it as no worse than 10F off, at best 1F, when measuring dark to black bodies, respectively.  Its rubber coating makes an easy grip.  The trigger has a sharp click, its not soft and gummy.  The LCD is easy to see, and the best angle for viewing its LCD is also the best angle for measuring, perpendicular to the measured surface.  Beware that when the measured point is fairly close and localized, regional changes in irregular or curves surfaces can happen, like pottery, cups, and mugs.\n\nUsing a black mug and pot, I checked IR readings against 32F ice water and 212F boiling water.  The temperature was compared against an Agilent thermocouple.  The IR reading was 0.5-2F off from the immersed probe.  IR reads of a hot Calrod heater was compared against a thermocouple to 900F+, and the IR thermometer read true, far above its rated temperature.  It read body temperature 0-2F off compared to a standard oral thermometer!\n\nAt extremes changes of ambient temperature, the focusing lens need to acclimatize, the manual recommends 30 minutes.  For example, if taken out to a hot summer day of 100F, from 70F air conditioning, the unit may read low.  Likewise, from a warm car to the outdoors during winter. This low cost unit uses a Fresnel plastic lens which is prone to thermal deformation more than other lens materials.  How much the error is depends on the extent of the difference between one ambient temp and another: if used too soon the IR light may not be optimally focused onto the IR detector.\n\nI am impressed, so I bought another!  I've been looking for a good deal on these for years, even Harbor Freight can't match it.\n\nWith 2 units now to compare I tested acclimatization, I took one unit to a 73F cold airconditioned room and left one out doors at 85F for 1 hour.  Sure, enough, they were off ~3F when they were reading nearly identical earlier.  After 1 hour with both units in the same room, they were off from 0-0.5F, awesome!",

            "UNFORGIVEN is marvelous moviemaking.  Clint Eastwood's direction and performance are haunting, evocative and original.  Avoiding a lot of the standard western cliches, Eastwood has fashioned a dark character study in which one's past resurfaces and no matter how hard you try to justify it, the truth wins out, and once you've killed, it's not so hard to do it again.  Clint has assembled a fine supporting cast as well:  Morgan Freeman (who would later work with Clint and win an Oscar in \"Million Dollar Baby\") is fine as Ned, Clint's former partner who joins him for one \"last\" job; Gene Hackman won an Oscar for his portrayal of Sheriff Little Bill, whose moral code is singular and unquestioned; Frances Fisher (a former Mrs. Eastwood) as the rebellious prostitute who wants to mete her own kind of justice; Jaime Woolvetz as the young gunfighter who idolizes Clint and killing; Saul Rubinek as a writer who finds out the truth isn't always what it is said to be; and Richard Harris as British Bob, an English assassin with tales taller than the Sequoias.  Although I found the film to drag in places, it's finale is riveting and Clint is reminiscent of Dirty Harry Callahan in his showdown with Hackman.\n\nUNFORGIVEN resurrected a pretty dead genre with this 1992 film, and its four Oscars helped plant Eastwood in the hall of great film makers.",

            "First, let me say that this free edition of North and South is no longer riddled with errors. Yes, there are some places where sentences are cut off after Dr. and Mrs., but that isn't unusual. Any other awkwardness of reading comes only from the old fashioned spelling and punctuation common in a book of this era.\n\nNorth and South is the interesting tale of Margaret Hale, torn from her idyllic home in the S. of England to live in the dirty, busy industrial N. It tells of John Thornton, and his admiration and love for Margaret, who at first considers him uncouth and ungentlemanly. She has no love for those in trade, and Thornton runs one of the mills that blackens Milton with smoke. In the same way, his Mother considers Margaret haughty and spoiled. During the two years Margaret comes of age there she befriends a laborer's family, gains a greater understanding of the quality of the people, and comes to learn much about herself.\n\nNorth and South reminded me of Pride and Prejudice mixed with Jane Eyre -- an historical British romance, but not as light-hearted as Austin. It inclines to more sentimentality and idealism than Austin, but her hero is more likable than Bronte's Rochester. Gaskell impressed me by managing to show both sides of the industrial revolution; both the workers and Masters are presented fairly. And I came away with a sense of what life might have been like there.\n\nI read this book after reading Gaskell's Cranford and watching the BBC version of this book. I heartily recommend both watching the series and reading this. They are quite close, though not identical. I did feel the miniseries was more successful, however. North and South suffers, to my mind, with Gaskell's flights of moralizing and occasional wordiness.",

            "By 1976, the Bee Gees had released the smash albums, \"Main Course\" and \"Children of the World\", and had pulled off the two #1 singles, \"Jive Talkin\" and \"You Should Be Dancin\". Feeling the high of their first successful streak in nearly 4 years, the Bee Gees decided to embark on an extensive concert tour throughout the country. One concert, performed at the Forum in LA, was recorded and planned on as being released as the first ever-live Bee Gees album. The Bee Gees presented a fantastic concert on the night of December 20th 1976! From the show opener \"Gotta Get A Message To You\", to the lively concluding number, \"Lonely Days\", the Bee Gees gave a very enthusiastic and enjoyable performance. Barry's renditions of \"Words\" and \"Love So Right\" are very memorable, and Robin's vibrato blasting lead in \"I Started A Joke\" and \"Massachusetts\" is outstanding! The brotherly harmonies are impeccable throughout each incredible song on the two-disc set. Because of the incredible variety of songs from dance music, balladry, and 60's pop, it doesn't take much to enjoy this album. I'm particularly partial to the incredibly energetic version of \"Jive Talkin\" and the beautifully performed, \"Nights On Broadway\". The Bee Gees are truly masters in all aspects of music, including live performance. \"Here At Last...Bee Gees...Live\" is really a fine example of the Bee Gees' ability to give a nearly flawless live performance. All in all, this is a wonderful CD to have in any collection, and by far one of the finest concerts ever released on record.",

            "I purchased two of these -- one each for work and home Macs -- some four years ago, before the advent of Mac OS X.  I previously had tried the Kensington TurboRing Trackball, which was a good idea but seriously flawed in implementation, both hardware and software.  This Microsoft trackball continues Microsoft's long tradition of excellent input hardware.  I've been a fan of Microsoft mice for as long as they've been making them, and this has not disappointed.\n\nThe Mac OS X driver software deserves special mention.  It provides full mapping of all buttons.  Due to this I can switch the left two buttons from their default modes, in which the lower button is primary and the upper is \"right click\".  This caused serious strain in my RSI-afflicted hand, but swapping them did away with this.  The other buttons are mappable, too, both to standard functions (for example, Forward & Back) and key combinations (Command-[, Command-], which give you Forward & Back functionality in the Finder).  If you're really shortcut crazy, you can add Control, Command and Option click variants for each key.  (The Scroll wheel is also clickable.)\n\nThe \"Microsoft Mouse\" driver software supports global settings and settings for specific applications.  This includes the ability to use the Microsoft acceleration/speed settings or the System settings (from the Mac's own \"Mouse\" system preference) on a per-application basis.  It's really quite good.\n\nAfter years of daily use, the track ball is getting a bit sticky in its grooves.  I don't know if there was some sort of low-friction coating that has worn off, or if the ball bearings it rests upon are worn down or no longer turning in their plastic sockets or simply clogged with dust behind the bearings, or something else entirely.  When it gets sticky, I pop the ball out, clean the ball bearings off, and things improve for a few days.  After so many years of use, I really can't complain, and at some point I'll buy a new one just like this to replace it!\n\nPROS: nice size and feel, four buttons plus clickable Scroll Wheel, buttons fully programmable, excellent Mac OS X driver software, ball easy to remove for cleaning\n\nCONS: scroll-click combo hard to use (so mostly I don't), that's about it.\n\nHighly recommended.",

            "Throughout the early 1970s there was a battle of the fusion bassists -- between Return to Forever's Clarke and whichever bassist Weather Report happened to have at the time.  For a period that was Miroslav Vitous, but most notably it was Jaco Pastorius.  Pastorius was mostly a fretless electric bass player, but Clarke was equally adept at electric bass and acoustic double bass.  The solo LPs they released seemed to be in part demonstration records, saying \"Look what I can do on the bass!\".\nThis is particularly true of the electric tracks on this album, Clarke's second for CBS.  The opening track, 'Silly Putty', has always annoyed me -- strong on virtuosity but an unattractive tune.  In general, the electric numbers have dated worse than the acoustic ones.  The title track is a gorgeous melody but the stand-out track is the acoustic 'Song for John -- Parts 1 & 2'.  Corea is particularly good here, in a surprisingly understated acoustic piano performance.\nI've known this album for 25 years.  When it first came out, it was recognised quickly as a good record -- certainly his best thus far -- but perhaps not quite a classic.  But it's a very marginal decision.  The follow-up, 'Schooldays', is more fun, but not quite as much care went into it as went into 'Journey to Love'.",

This pedal is amazing and I highly recomend it for any guitar player. Most of my pedals are Boss because they only build their equipment to industrial strength and standards.

            "I have looked high and low for this title.  After many searches I finally found it.  However after three hours and many deaths I was done.  The game was beat.  3 hours.  For an RPG that is to short, [heck] it takes me longer to beat something Legends of Wrestling or Contra.\nThis particular game starts off with one [heck] of a bang.  When you are first loading up they included (granted a little grainy and not with the origional music) the intro to Dragon Ball Z.  From there you jump right into the game.\nTHe game starts at the beggining of Raditz and goes all the way through Frieza.  YOu start off tehnically at level 2 (After the first meaningless task) before you do any fighting.  After Raditz shows up and kidnapps Gohan you are off to save him.  However you arrive at your house and walk all the way there.  YOu help out people and eventually learn the Solar Flare attack when you finally face off against Raditz.  From there on it's just a matter of winning and than going to the afterlife.\nI won't continue that because people who play this probably know the story line.  However I don't remember GOku on his way to Raditz picking flowers for a little girl, or getting a Dinosaurs Egg back.\nThe tasks are fairly meaningles but they get you EXP and sometimes increase your speed (which is needed). You collect flight charges in order to fly.  Also many characters make cameo appearences and just tlaking to them gets you 500 exp.\nBoss battles are the most disapointing.  They are all the same.  Once you learn Solar Flare (and that is just before facing Raditz) all boss battles are cake walks.  Charge up SOlar flare slightly than charge up Ki Blast or Kamahmaha to at least 50% than release.  Keep up that pattern and move around objects and you are guarenteed to win every time.  SOme times they shoot at you but most times they wait to get in close range and than punch you.\nWHich brings me to the next point, Damage control.  There is no way to tell how badly you are damaging your foes.  Granted small things like snakes and squirles goe down in a single shot but from the crab on you have no way of knowing how badly you are damaging your foe.  YOu may kill a foe in single punch one time than the next it takes 12 hits.  I am seriouse that is the way it is.\nHowever the game does very closly follow the key points of the story.  The only change was at the end with Frieza (in the show he faces frieza level 4 in the game you face all 4 forms).  Beyond that you do get little clips at certain moments (like arriving on King Kais place or off to face Raditz).  The music is also well done and they even included GOku yelling out KAmahamaha when he does the attack at least 50%.  For a die hard Dragon Ball Z Fan this is a god send however for the average gamer this is a renter, to easy for novices but to hard for little ones.",

The only thing the two women have in common is their celebrity and that they both died before their time.

            "LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON is the fifth and final book in the Hathaways Series.  It is the story of Beatrix Hathaway, the youngest Hathaway sibling.  Beatrix is very unconventional.  As readers of the series will recall, Bea has a great affinity for animals and in fact has an interesting menagerie from an orphaned hedgehog and a three legged cat to an unbroken horse and goats.  Bea is friends with Prudence who has a suitor, Captain Christopher Phelan, who is off fighting in the Crimean war.  Prudence gets a letter from Christopher yearning for some news from home and reporting about a camp dog.  Bea is intrigued by Christopher's letter, especially his problem with the dog.  When Prudence has no intention to reply, Bea agrees to masquerade as Prudence with a response.  Soon Christopher and Bea are falling in love by letter.  When Christopher returns from war, he comes looking for his love \"Prudence\".\n\nI really liked this book.  Christopher is a man who has been deeply changed by war and still deals with PTSD from his experiences.  The deception about the identity of the letter writer only lasts for about half the book.  The two then have to deal with the consequences of Christopher's war experiences.  I really enjoyed that Christopher is a good man.  His demons are well represented and dealt with in a serious fashion.  As to Bea, I have always enjoyed her crazy animals.  It is entirely fitting that she is brought together with her mate by concern over a dog.  The discussion about the mating habits of squirrels was hysterical\n\nAs the last book in the series, it was nice to see the family again and get an update on them.\n\nFor fans of the series, this book is absolutely necessary.  For those who haven't read the other books, this book can exist without them, but you get a better, fuller experience if you read them in order.",

It protects perfectly (though if I'm out in the sun for prolonged periods of time I do need to reapply as with any sunscreen), is easy to rub in, feels lightweight on, and doesn't disagree with my skin.  Yes, the scent is a bit floral where I would prefer something unscented or coconut-y, but it's a lot better than some other brands I've tried (Juice Beauty SPF 30 Sport Sunscreen comes to mind as being the absolute worst sunscreen I have ever smelled.)\n\nI'd definitely recommend this",

I'm in my mid 40's now and yet I still have them stored in the attic waiting for me to pull them out for my kids, who are currently 6.  My Mom thought to keep them, along with my old Star Wars toys, also going to my kids when they get old enough.\n\nIf you like putting models together of any sort I would recommend you give Tamiya a try, even if you aren't into WWII stuff.  You never know you might learn to appreciate it as I did.  One day I'm going to break out my modeling equipment and start building again.  Hopefully side by side with my kids.  I saw a few kits I'd like to buy and build.  That M3 Stewart Light Tank looks pretty awesome.  I might just go get it right now!\n\nDon't be shy, at under $7 you can't go wrong with this kit.  While you are at it get the German infantry set.  Also Tamiya paints are among the best.  They totally blow away Testors paints and are water based so clean-up is a snap.\n\nGet to modeling and let me know how you liked the kit.",

            "The Soundcore Spirit Sports are very well built and the magnets are very strong and have no problem staying on my neck. They are pretty comfortable to wear and stay in my ears pretty well. However, other issues kind of put me off the experience of using them. Sound Quality is decent, it sounds OK but in my ears, they don't sound that much different from the Soundbuds Slim. Battery life was OK, the stand-by time for me wasn't great because even when I don't listen to music that much on a day, I would still have to charge these by the end of the night. Then there is the issue of calls lagging when moving a few feet away from my phone. It's kind of annoying to just a bit from my phone only to find that the other person is hearing me lag in the call. The mic is also at a pretty low volume when I talk to people. Also another problem is watching videos and listening to music. For some reason, if I start listening to anything when the buds are coming from a state of not playing anything, sound will not play at full volume at first but instead, gradually gain volume until they reach the volume that it was set to last. I never had earbuds do that to me and I found that weird when I first experienced it. So overall, the buds are built well and are very comfortable, but sound quality is a bit lackluster considering I spent more money for these than the Soundbuds slim. The other issues definitely does not help as the lag in calls and the gradually gain when I start listening to anything add to the annoyance of using these. These buds are built well and the magnets are great, but the other issues are what make these earbuds harder to use for me. Update: Anker's customer support is one of the best in the business. I contacted support after they messaged me to reach out to them after my review and they decided to send me their upgraded version the Soundcore Spirit Pros. After using these for about a week, they fix every issue that I was having and on top of that, they sound a lot better and fit in my ears a lot better than the Spirit Sports. I added a star for their efforts in making me happy and if you buy any Anker product, you are assured to get amazing support for your product.",

It's great.  Better than most of their post \"Arenalize\" music, IMO.  You can hear on this album why Def Leppard were originally considered part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (along with Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, et al).

He was legitimately depressed.\nI took him to the vet over and over and they concluded it was allergies and gave me various prescriptions to try to fix the problem. But nothing worked.\nOver five hundred dollars later, I gave up and looked for alternatives. In addition to switching to grain free food (which I did about a month before starting this supplement), I feed this to my baby once or twice a day. He loves how it tastes too!

            "Peel back the facade of \"Leave It To Beaver\" America and what do you find?  \"American Beauty.\"  This film, as one of my friends accused, portrays only dysfunctional families and individuals.  Am I  missing something?  Aren't we all, in some way, functioning outside the  parameters of our factory specs?  Or are \"things,\" such as $4000  sofas and illicit relationships, what our Designer had in mind for us to  pursue?\nThis movie, through brilliant and understated acting, takes us  into the lives of people who are dealing with these questions in  drastically different ways.  The film's haunting, slow-paced honesty sits  down beside you and casually drapes an arm over your shoulder.  The  question is whispered in your ear as you stare straight ahead:  \"Do  you see yourself in any of these people?\"  And, as the plot twists  tighter toward the end with surprising energy, you realize that you've been  suckered into jumping aboard a hurtling train that's headed toward a ravine  with the bridge washed out.  Washed out by the power of small, but deadly  choices--choices we all face at some point in our family histories.\nJust  as Kevin Spacey's character begins to turn from the brink and see the  beauty of his own wife and daughter, the dark honesty of his choices  catches up with him.  We are left to decide for ourselves which is more  dangerous--to jump off the train or to jump on as it hurtles toward the  danger of \"American Beauty.\"  Either way you jump, the impact of  the landing will leave you stunned at the end of the film.",

            "A newspaper reporter (Sally Field) does a story on what appears to be a federal strike force investigation of a man (Paul Newman) who once had ties with the Mafia. Only it's not true, and after the published story has dire affects on Newman's life, he seeks revenge. The theme is about the responsibility the press has to not just print anything it wants and use words like \"alleged\" and \"sources said\" to protect itself. Newman does an excellent job, as usual, though Field is not strong enough as an actress to do her part very well. The very end (after Newman has made monkeys out of Field and others on the paper) is a bummer, too, with Newman picking up stakes and moving on, as if this little episode was all he had to do in Miami, the movie's setting: hero riding off into the sunset syndrome here. The movie presents a good, complex story, though - well paced and, except for Field, well acted by all involved. Definitely worth a watch.",

            "While many people want a movie to scare them around the month of October, others might welcome this halloweeny laugh fest instead!\n\n\"Dracula - Dead and Loving it\" spoofs the traditional story of Dracula, using two of the greatest parody film makers of all time -- Mel Brooks and Leslie Nielson! It's amazing to see the way Brooks was able to retool a typically frightening story into a comical triumph. Each joke, gag, and over the top character simply smacks of Mel Brooks wit.\n\nI dare you to keep from cracking up when you watch Renfield pounce on every creepy crawly he finds (while trying to avoid the dreaded enimas from the insane asylum), or when Van Helsing (played by Mel Brooks himself) enters into a battle of wills against Dracula where each man tries to have the last word (it's way funnier than it might sound), or when Dracula creates a farcical mess when he attempts to control Mina with his mind powers. Even some of the simplest sight gags and physical comedy are enough to make you crack a smile!\n\nSadly there isn't much in the way of special features on this disc. However, there is a very thorough and funny feature commentary with Mel Brooks, co-writers Rudy DeLuca and Steve Haberman, and actors Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck.\n\nThis is a true Halloween treat, and a great break from the monotony of endless gory horror movies. This movie is definitely worth adding to your collection.",

After two successful albums in TUNA and NINE LIVES, they hit hard in 1980 with HI INFIDELITY. In a sense, this could be the rock-and-roll comparison to Michael Jackson's THRILLER. Every song is a masterpiece in its own right, even the ones that didn't hit the charts. From good rock-and-roll to powerhouse ballads, there is so much variety on this album, and a purchase of it is a must if you want an example of perfect rock music.\n\nDON'T LET HIM GO - very rhythmic opening, with a killer guitar and synthesizer\n\nKEEP ON LOVING YOU - THE rock ballad of the '80s, if not of all time\n\nFOLLOW MY HEART - rockin' song with a catchy chorus and awesome guitars from Gary Richrath\n\nIN YOUR LETTER - fun song with a very nice piano from Neal Doughty\n\nTAKE IT ON THE RUN - another powerhouse ballad from the boys; a true '80s classic\n\nTOUGH GUYS - another catchy song with nice synthesizers again and great guitar from Richrath\n\nOUT OF SEASON - catchy chorus and great rhythm\n\nSHAKIN' IT LOOSE - fun song\n\nSOMEONE TONIGHT - Bruce Hall takes lead here and does a fine job (with Kevin Cronin on background)\n\nI WISH YOU WERE THERE - another ballad from the boys; very nice song",

            "I've always had a love for samurai and ninja games and Genma Onimusha is a welcome addition to my collection. The game follows the story of Samanosuke and his quest to find the princess. As you can tell, Onimusha has a very basic and cliched storyline, but still ends up being an interesting experience. The game is very action oriented and resembles Resident Evil in both control and presentation. The fighting system is reasonably good and the character animation is fluid and realistic. I must note that the game is quite HARD and can get frustrating quite often. I should also note that Onimusha is a pretty short game. I finished it in about three days. The game doesn't offer much replay value, but the general presentation of the game is very well implemented and keeps the game interesting throughout your quest. I don't want to sound too negative, though. The music is very well orchestrated and the sound effects are appropriate, though some of the voice acting is a little strange at times. If you liked Resident Evil, but always thought it should have more action, it would be a good decision to pick up Genma Onimusha.",

But its size means you can tuck it into those spots where you need some instant air-cleaning.  For example, it's great to keep by the stove when you're cooking.  Your range hood may draw out air, but it doesn't remove odors.  The charcoal in the Febreze filter will make quick work of that for you.  One of the best things about the fan is that it plugs directly into an electrical outlet -- sort of like a very large night light.  Thus it takes up little space and can easily be moved from one spot to another, as needed.  I've had my two for years, and I'd hate to be without them.",

            "This book follows Gogol Ganguli, the son of Bengali immigrants, through the first thirty some-odd years of his life. The book is rich in detail, excellent in describing the traditional Indian customs, and describing how Indian immigrants cope and live in America; however, some of the plot is predictable and, frankly, not much of a plot. Gogol changes his name early in his life because he is ashamed by it's unorthodox origins and sound. We follow Gogol's early love affairs and how he perceives himself and how his perceived sex appeal is tied into his name. His romances come and go; finally, in the end, after the destractions of relationships are behind him, he reads the book by the author who inspired his name. It all comes to a satisfying, nostalgic finish. This book is a fine novel, well structured, rich in detail, competant in its organization, albiet a little short on the plot. As one other reviewer mentioned, it reads like a long version of a short story. This is not the best foundation for a novel, but this is what Lahiri does best, and we are treated to her craft.",

            "Well... here's the deal...\n\nBlade Runner stands as one of those films whose editting and final cut were always a subject for debate. As you may know there are two known cuts of this film: the original theatrical version (shunned by many who claimed it was a producer's cut who did not believe in Scott's true vision) and the director's cut (which is not really the director's cut... it is more a screenplay's cut... with some changes who merely unmade some of the things the producers did on the previous cut).\n\nIt is this second version that you will find here (while the first version is no longer available) with a face lift... a new transfer... better sound... and that's it.\n\nIn one way, this version is badly needed because all the previous Blade Runner DVD incarnations come from the first years of DVD - when you didn't even have a decent menu. And since the DVD technology has evolved a lot since then... why not a new version of Blade Runner, right?\n\nBut.......\n\nThe mystique surrounding Blade Runner says that director Ridley Scott never REALLY got HIS REAL version of this film. And more... A such an important and much loved film like this should have lots of extras to bring a new light to a film that is so fundamental and trendsetting.\n\nAnd it seems that after 25 years, all the legal problems preventing all this from happenning were really sorted out between the film's former producers who battled for years for the film's rights.\n\nAnd now, with all problems solved, we know that in 2007, we'll have that multi-disc version all the fans always dreamt of.\n\nSO, THE DEAL IS... IF YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT THIS VERSION, BUY THIS EDITION. The good thing is you won't even go through those stupid snap cases anymore. Even if you already have it, the better image and sound on this release will certainly make up for it.\n\nBUT IF YOU CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING LESS THAT THE WHOLE MULTI-DISC EDITION COMPRISING ALL THE VERSIONS AND TONS OF EXTRAS... forget about this version and wait a few months for the longer, bigger, more complete, celebratory, multi versioned, multi disc set that will give you the FULL BLADE RUNNER deal.\n\nIt will cost more, naturally, but we've been saving money for it since our childhood, right? ;-)\n\nI'm a big fan. So I'll wait. This version is a quick, just and much needed repairment: a great new transfer (with no extras) for those who just want the film. An entry level I'd say. And I think it is good that Warner Home Video has this version for those who just want the film - at bargain price.\n\nBut more is coming in 2007. In full!!\nSo, I'll wait impatiently!!!!!",

I tend to look for holes or flaws in reasoning and I just didn't find any here.\n\nI was completely surprised by the ending and even though I don't think I would have done it that way, it fit in perfect with the rest of the book and made a great ending.  I loved the elements of fear that were put in the story and how the main character dealt with it.  Everything fit together nicely.\n\nThis is a page turner for sure.

Play this for your loser stoner/headbanger pals and enjoy them running away in FEAR. And guys, the  DRUM MACHINE was part of the sound. It was geeky guys with grudges and lots  of attitude that propelled these hateful missles of rock. Scratchy guitars,  grating bass, shouted/spooky/spoken vocals, and really COOL and (stoic by  contrast) DRUM MACHINE sonic  epics about child abuse, boredom, immolation,  porn, being drunk, jobs, and the life of the everyman-wise guy.

            "This book was a lively, vibrant account of WWII from the perspectives of diverse, well-developed characters.  _Winds of War_ recounted the great historical events occuring from 1938-39 until the end of 1941, but presented them in a way that reflected believable sentiments real people felt at the time.  The characters of the Jastrow family were particularly interesting for me, who as a Jew, try to understand the element in which they found themselves trying to escape Europe, and how they responded to it.\nThe protagonist, an ambitious and succesful naval officer is the patriarch of the model naval WASP family.  He maneuvers through the thickest power circles in his time with tact and ease, and is really a lot of fun to imagine.\nWouk basically conjures a bunch of extremely gifted characters, some beautiful, some brilliant, and weaves them into a fascinating narrative of the most influential years of the 20th century.\nHistorical fiction at its best, if you want a fun yet accurate portrayal of WWII, this is a good pick.",

Sure, the Peart influence is not heard on this recording, but Geedy Lee and Alex Lifeson(and the original drummer)were still young lads exploring their individual talents and putting them together on an album for the first time. For 1974, most bands new or old couldn't help but sound like what was most popular, and the Pink Floyd influence is detected on \"Here Again.\" There's also a lot of Led Zeppelin similarities in most of the songs, but as we know now, Rush eclipsed Led Zeppelin through the years to become a solid band with tremendous talent and originality, and their signature sound is not absent from this recording when you listen to the guitar licks on the opening track \"Finding My Way,\" and of course \"Working Man,\" one of the greatest radio anthems of all-time with an amazing guitar jam that can't be compared to anything else.",

Second, is that you can play as Mario, Luigi, Wario or Yoshi. Third, is you can open up a plethora of great mini games by catching rabbits, some of which are more fun than the main game and give you hours of enjoyment.\n\nThe main game is the same as the N64 version, however the graphics and control are a bit better on the DS. This is a great game to have for the DS. Some of the mini games especially show off the power of DS.

The GPS will not fly off the dash, and operation will be a lot easier because the bracket will hold the unit stationary.\n\nIf you need a bracket for a marine application, clearly this is the one.  I have also found that the base of my GPS12 bracket (also Garmin) is identical and allows me to swap between the GPSMap 76 and GPS12.

            "Achtung Baby is a sensational rock album that every music lover should own. U2 created this 12-track CD in Berlin in 1990-91 around the time of the collapse of the decrepit socialist state of East Germany, and this \"zeitgeist\" is reflected in the style of the record. Heavy emotional lyrics about love, lust and loss, driving guitar, and clattering dance and techno rhythms are brilliantly fused together in one of the most powerful records ever released.\n\nMy Track Review of Achtung Baby:\n\nZoo Station - Groundbreaking lead track uses a jagged industrial rhythm and distorted vocals . The Zoo Station was an East Berlin landmark railway terminal back in the Communist era that the U2 crew visited as the album took shape.\n\nEven Better Than The Real Thing - One of the key songs of the whole decade, this fantastic recording has that \"wow\" factor that made it truly memorable. Brilliant video, and it heralded U2's 1992-93 Zoo TV media & information blitz. Even Better... came with a groovy dancefloor remix by Perfecto that had a chart life of its own. A big hit in July 1992.\n\nOne - A very special song, One is an emotional ballad that has taken on many layers of meaning over the years, and reveals raw emotions that U2 are so good at displaying. At once, a great pop hit in April 1992, an anthem for the ages, a heartbreak song, and a statement of unity and solidarity. My favourite song on the album.\n\nUntil The End Of The World - An awesome rock song. This has dramatic introduction, almost-apocalyptic lyrics, dense rhythms and it works superbly as a concert track. Really exciting.\n\nWho's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses - A medium paced track with Bono's vocals bathed in a wash of hazy electronica and featuring memorable choruses. A 5th single from the album , it hit the Top 10 in December 1992.\n\nSo Cruel - This song is a masterpiece and shows U2 at the very height of its songwriting powers. This slow, compelling song builds to an unforgettable crescendo in the third verse and its superior lyric reveals the power of obsessive love.\n\nThe Fly - An immediate attention-grabbing single released in advance of the album in November 1991 and reaching #1, this was our first glimpse of U2's radically-different new sound for the new decade. In amongst the slogans and the shades, there is a killer pop song here with that familiar spine-tingling moment in the chorus when U2 rises to a plane no other band can reach.\n\nMysterious Ways - I never grow tired of this terrific funky song. What a great bassline! I think this mid-paced track is alluring and accessible while still sounding suitably exotic (the shimmering North African scenes on its video and the concert belly dancer add to the mystique!) A Top 3 hit in December 1991.\n\nTryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World - I don't listen to this one as much as the first eight classics, but it's still pretty good. A medium-tempo track.\n\nUltra Violet (Light My Way) - This has a great sound to it and is a relationship song with heavy lyrics and a memorable refrain\n\nAcrobat - Many reviewers like this one, though it isn't a favourite of mine. Again a powerful lyrical song.\n\nLove Is Blindness - Brilliant slow track to close this landmark album, this lays bare the bleak emotions of a difficult and painful emotional entanglement.\n\nOverall, this album succeeds as a work of art, as an extension of the band's previous work, as a dance record and as a rock record. I enjoyed it as much as ever before when I played it through in running order a few days ago; such great music never goes out of date. It is my pick as the best rock album of the 1990's.\n\n5 stars",

            "I have just finished books 1-3 of the Comet Clement series.  I was hooked on the first one and each time the books ended, I could not wait until I could start the next one.  I either didn't notice, or it did not bother me if there were any grammatical or spelling errors, the books were that good to me. I am a fast reader and will probably re-read this series later on.\n\nI enjoyed the premise of the book, about the comet, how it was found and how the government became involved and the growth of the characters within the books. I also enjoyed how the author kept up with John and Colin, Emily and Sarah Rose and how their lives are intertwined.  Although there are many other major characters in the books, I'm glad the author gave me a glimpse every once in a while of these four. (I hope I have their names correct).\n\nI have just ordered  Book #4 and am on my way to bed to begin reading it.  Although the books are fiction, they seem to be on the cutting edge of science and technology  although  I'm not smart enough to know if these things could actually be made.  I'm just assuming the author did his research and knew what he was writing about, because it all made sense to me. LOL  It also reveals to me just how much the government can and does keep secret from its citizens. I, myself, would want to know what the Inner Circle knew and would be very upset to know it was kept from me.  Sometimes there are things one wants to do before death comes; seeing old friends, patching up broken relationships, going places one has dreamed of seeing and having the time to do these things, knowing time is running out.  Just my opinion of course. Anyway, I LOVE these books and will continue to read them.\n\nAs an aside, the Inner Circle secret reminded me of Oak Ridge, Tennessee where the components of the first atom bomb  were built.  There were three different sections built with a mountain between 1 and 2 and another mountain between 2 and 3.  Neither section knew what the other one was doing, but the final product (plutonium I believe) was placed in a briefcase and carried by train to another state by a non-descript looking businessman where it was handed off and made into the bomb. The President and a few top secret advisors knew what was going on, but Vice-President Truman had no clue.  They even had to \"borrow\" silver bullion from the Treasury Dept to melt down to make silver wire because all the copper was being used overseas.  After the war, they had to give the silver back to the Treasury Dept and I believe our guide told us they recovered 99% of it!\n\nAnyway, get these books and read them...you will have the ride of your life as you get to know the characters, begin to care about them, hate some, cry for some, and cheer them on!\n\nThese books would make a GREAT series for the History Channel, maybe a two hour series once a week until the final book!  Someone could make that happen!",

            "Thanks to this very credible book, and of course, its author--many thanks, sir--I've dropped over forty pounds and am still dropping. This will be the hard part for some folks to understand, I've done it without exercising.  Why no exercising? Because I am disabled from a massive hemorrhagic stroke. I could not even walk more than ten feet without having to flop back down in my wheelchair.  Yesterday, because of the inclement weather in the Fort Worth/Dallas area (12 tornadoes!) I decided to try to walk to my doctor's office. I made it! Incredibly enough, I am losing at a rate of four pounds a week. I'm under the care of a physician because of multiple health challenges, pain being problem number one.\n\nI had lost 20 by being very calorie conscious. However it took a YEAR to lose that little poundage.  I had no idea that the \"wheat\" that is being peddled as wheat is NOT what I ate as a young girl.  All of the \"experts\" say that women can't lose weight as easily as a man. That is true...except for this new way of eating.  To me, this is no \"diet,\" it is a new way of eating and since it permits me to eat foods I love, what's the problem?\n\nI have another 50 or so pounds or so, but the BIG problem now is that nothing fits me...when this woman says she has nothing to wear, she really MEANS it.  While in the parking lot at my local Target, my pants fell off me!  Thankfully, I was between two cars when they did that little trick. Fortunately, I have a great sense of humor, but it could have been embarrassing.\n\nAlthough the book is rather thin on recopies, I've been a scratch cook for decades.  I hope he will come up with a recipe book but for heaven's sake use only products that one can find all over the world, not just at specialty or Asian food stores. Ground flaxseed from Red Mill is easy to find without having to pay through the nose at a health food store.\n\nI have cheated a few times without negative effects, however I don't make a habit of it.  There's nothing like a Swiss cheese omelet for breakfast. I don't even miss the toast.\n\nBottom Line: But this book and FOLLOW IT.  If you hit a plateau, don't sweat it, it will be for a relatively short period of time and you'll be on your way to dropping weight and girth again.\n\nThe only problem I'm going to have is going through Passover without eating matzoh. As part of the stroke I had, most all of my teeth shattered and broken. I have no opposing teeth, so it's \"fun\" trying to eat something hard...made with wheat.  I'm 71 years YOUNG and must live to be at least 100 because I have so many doctors to bury.",

            "I just watched this again because it appeared on Prime. What a great movie it is. This is a spy movie for adults, even more mature than a Bourne movie. Robert De Niro gives a wonderful, understated performance. His character is tough as nails, but also obviously vulnerable in the way only a seasoned actor can be. As you watch this, contrast it with a James Bond film. Bond inevitably smirks through every scene, De Niro in Ronin, on the other hand, looks like he's constantly nervous about his surroundings. Sure, it's not as \"cool,\" but it sure brings you into the world of the film.\n\nI remember seeing this when it first came out in theaters and enjoying it but not being as impressed as I was with this most recent viewing. Sometimes a film grows on you over time, and that's certainly the case here. There are a couple moments that I don't like, but they are very minor. I can recall two instances where the director set up a scene by flashing to some object before the object became relevant, and in both cases the forward flashes struck me as a bit clumsy. The \"wrong way\" sign is the more egregious of the two accompanied as it is by a surge in the music that doesn't quite work. The \"wrong way on the highway\" chase scene is very good...but it's impossible to do a better chase scene like that than the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/To-Live-and-Die-in-L-A-Special-Edition/dp/B0007XBK7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">To Live and Die in L.A. (Special Edition)</a>. But Ronin is overall a better movie than that one.\n\nThe acting is top notch throughout. You expect greatness from Robert De Niro (and he delivers) and Jean Reno (who is also tremendous here). Sean Bean is perfect, and Stellan Skarsgard is a revelation. I believe this was the first time I saw him on film and he brings a tremendous presence to the screen.\n\nThere will be a few scenes that stick with you after watching this. The \"reflex\" scene, the \"ambush with a cup of coffee\" scene, the \"home surger\" scene, and \"post surgery discussion\" scene where the film gets its title. That last is actually a very polite interrogation as Michael Lonsdale tries to figure out if he's about to be murdered by the man whose life he has just saved.\n\nThe subtext is everything in this film. Even if you don't grab it the first time, chances are the scenes will linger with you. Maybe I thought it was a little too sure of itself on the first viewing, but with reflection I've come to realize that yes, it is that good.",

            "Yes, this is the Nitty Gritty's best album they ever released!  When I discovered it in the early 70's, I must have played it 50 times in a couple of months (no minor feat, I had a couple of hundred lp's by that time),  lent it to a friend and never saw it again.  Well, I just found a mint copy  among a collection I just purchased and had the pleasure of becoming  reacquainted with \"an old friend\".  Following in the tradition of  Sweetheart of the Rodeo by the Byrds, Poco and Buddy Holly, among other  influences diverse and many, \"Uncle Charlie\" is a very hard  record to pigeonhole.  It comebines elements of folk-rock, country, boogie  and blues, old timey, bluegrass and rock 'n roll.  But in each and every of  it's 20+ songs (some short, some instrumental, some 3+ minutes), the band  never sounded better, fresher, more at peace with themselves and the world.  Highlights, all vocals, are Mr. Bojangles (the best version I've heard  with due respect to Jerry Jeff Walker), Some of Shelley's Blues, Living  without You, Rave On, House at Pooh Corner and my favorite on the album and  maybe the best \"lost\" country rock song just waiting to be  discovered, Propiniquity (written by Mike Nesmith along with Shelley's  Blues).  On side 2, you get to hear a bit of Uncle Charlie playing and  talking.  Somehow, his \"appearance\" doesn't detract from the  album but seems to add to it's charm.  If you like roots rock, buy this  album and hear what roots rock sounded like 30 years ago.",
            "This albm ranks right up there with Boston's eponymous debut and Heart's \"Dreamboat Annie\" as one of the greatest debut albums ever. Def Leppard had been together for almost five years and had an EP out when their first album, \"On Through The Night\", was releaaed in 1981.\n\n\"On Through The Night\" is the most different sounding Def Leppard album Def Leppard ever released. By advised: you are not going to find \"Photograph\" or \"Pour Some Sugar On Me\" on this cd. Instead, you will find the band experimenting with different sounds and being very creative. Even before their big breakthrough with \"Pyromania\", Def Leppard was already standing head and shoulders over all other 1980s' bands.\n\n\"On Through The Night\" kicks off with the weakest song on the album. \"Rock Brigade\" has a nice chorus, but is really just a filler track. Things pick up quickly with \"Hello America\". This was the band's second single release. This is a great song, the keyboard effects are really cool a one reviewer pointed out. \"Sorrow Is A Woman\" is actually IMO a precursor the acoustic version of \"Two Steps Behind\". There's electric guitar on here, but the acoustic guitar is also very prominent. The song itself is a dark, midtempo ballad that is possibly Def's most underrated song ever. \"It Could Be You\" is a loud, fast Leppard rocker that hints at the later days but still fits well with the rest of the album. \"Satellite\", as many reviewers pointed out, has a 1960s' vibe to it, and is a fun litle ditty.\n\nTrack six is one of Leppard's darkest songs in their entire cannon. \"When The Walls Came Dumbling Down\" is like Led Zeppelin, 1980s' style. I liken this in a way to \"When The Levee Breaks\". Most reviewers will disagree with me on this, but I hear a lot of Zeppelin in this track (also, check out \"Die Haard The Hunter\" from \"Pyromania\"). It is a cool rocker with a creepy intro. \"Wasted\" is the song that started it all. This is their first single, and my what a debut: the guitars are awesome, the drums are fierce and forceful and Elliot sings his lungs out. My favorite song on the album. \"Rocks Off\" is a \"Hello America\" - type track, very fast paced and with a faux audience. Not great, but cool. \"it Don't Matter\" is a throwaway, but \"Amswer To The Master is a great rocker. Closing out the album is the nearly eight minute \"Overture\". This starts off a slwo and builds up into an awesome rocker and a great close to the album.\n\nThis is an awesome cd. This issn't Def Lepaprd's best album (I rank \"Pyromania\" and \"Hysteria\" ahead of this one), but it is an excellent album.",

We are given a wonderful glimpse into the life of Andrea, a young woman coming to grips with her womanhood, her adulthood and her sexuality. She learns, as the film teaches the audience, that while linked the three are distinctly different. Andrea learns to differentiate between the states of her heart, her body and her mind. She learns that she can't allow herself to be ruled by the her emotions, her sexual desires or her pragmatism alone but instead must live her life by holding all three in a delicate balance.\nSecondly, this film also marks the maturity of Dominique Swain as an actress. Although Swain was never a child actress in the classic sense of the word, her initial starring role was the remake of the film Lolita. While Lolita was also a mature role, her approach to playing the character was actually somewhat juvenile, as the role demanded in many senses. Here, Swain has shown that she possesses the skills and potential to remain a serious actress for years to come.\nThe story alone makes this film a 4 star picture.

            "First, the description is as it says, I've no blame there. I just hadn't noticed that it lacked any info about a light - frankly, I didn't even know the older ones had one. My girlfriend has had a previous version of this watch, exact same design and colors and such, for quite a while. Yes, she's a full grown twenty-something adult, don't be rude. It finally stopped working fully (and it had been through a lot, water, dirt, sand, so no qualms there), and a new battery didn't resolve it, so I went online to find her a replacement since she loved it and was super excited to find it here.\n\nI didn't even know her old one had a light, but lo and behold it does, the bright green indiglo kind. Sadly, this model does not. I can't with good conscious rate any lower than 5 stars, because my gosh do these watches hold up, and there was nothing misleading in the description. It's Timex's prerogative to decide it's not worth it to put lights in kids watches anymore. But MAN, do I ever I wish they still did, it was the perfect surprise to replace her favorite watch, and now it's missing a great functionality that we both pretty much require in our watches.",

            "Our African Grey parrot (Socrates) had been a joy to us for about 25 years, imitating various sounds and voices, and talking up a storm.  Often we would hear my wife or mother in the next room, only to discover that neither one was there.  The telephone would ring, the doorbell sounded, someone was shouting at the dogs, just about any sound was fair game.\n\nSuddenly she (we thought that we bought a male, but males don't lay eggs) started picking herself and stopped talking.  The vet put a small collar on her to stop the picking, gave us an oral antibiotic to help heal the picked areas, put her on benadryl to stop any itching, and recommended that we start her on Lafeber Veggie Nutri-Berries to improve her nutrition.  Trying to get any type of medicine into a parrot is difficult at best, so we took to dripping the measured amount onto her Nutri-Berries.  Bingo, problem solved.\n\nWe also added more fruits and veggies to her diet.  Socrates is notoriously picky about her food, but the Nutri-Berries have been a hit with her.  She had her two week check-up today and the vet is extremely pleased with her progress.  Her feathers are filling back in, her picking wounds have healed up, she's back to shredding anything we put in her cage, and she has muttered a few words.  She's not back at 100% yet but we hope that she will be during her next check-up.\n\nWe have to hand it to our vet and to his recommendation for Nutri-Berries.  Everything is going in the right direction and it shouldn't be long now before the dogs are again being yelled at by her.",

That's it.\nThis has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it on NBC in the 60s, and when I saw the restored version last year in Seattle, the animated, standing-room-only crowd went from a gasp (as Burr looked down) to an outright shriek (when he looked up).

            "For months, DOA2 on the PS2 was competing for my attention with \"Soul Calibur\" for the Dreamcast at the office.  SC is surely more approachable, easier to get good at, and has better extras, but D0A2 has a fighting engine that is arguably superior.\nDOA2's controls include a button called \"free\", which must be understood and mastered before this game can be any fun at all.  While used for sidesteps and movement into the foreground/background (a trigger press also accomplishes this), the main point of \"free\" is to do \"holds\", which allow you to reverse an opponents attack and hurt him/her much worse than he/she was going to hurt you.  To hold a mid-level attack, just press free and back.  High and low attacks are held with free and diagonal backs on the d-pad.\nIt takes a LONG time to get the hang of this, but it is incredibly rewarding once you've done so, because it eliminates the \"tennis match\" style (DailyRadar's term) prevalent in so many fighting games -- one player unleashes a combo, the other player retaliates, etc.  Instead, you can dismantle the combo when it begins or (sometimes) halfway through.  Attackers can no longer use easy go-to moves on every series, because the defender will see it coming.  Instead, you have to conceal your style, or widen your offensive pallette.\nThe game also makes use of the arena -- instead of \"ring outs\" ending the match (as in Soul Calibur), two things can happen to an unlucky defender who's run out of room.  They may get knocked to a different level of the environment, sustaining damage, or they may be knocked into a hazard like an electified wall, taking heaps of damage.\nAs we'd expect from the PS2, the visuals are sumptuous.  Facial expressions in the story-mode close-ups are creepily realistic at times, even given the usual anime stylings.\nStory mode is a ridiculous mush of character moments and melodrama -- suitably \"hardcore\" single players may just want to play survival mode repeatedly to skip the incoherent babbling.  As you'd expect, playing against real people is much more fun, particularly the four-player tag-team, although you'll need to spend ... for extra controllers and a multi-tap to try it.\nWhat's not to like?  Well, the characters have a certain sameness to them, although that may be a design choice to avoid the cartoonishness of other fighting games (Tekken's ogres, giant pandas and wooden men are nowhere to be seen).  Also, the overt cheesecake factor may be offensive to some, although it is at times so over-the-top that you have to think the developers are pushing outrage for outrage's sake.

The song takes me back to my childhood when little girls were dressed for church on Sundays in dresses, black patent leather shoes with white lace anklets.  Little boys were in white shirts with ties and a jacket or a sweater, slacks and shoes were polished with their hair neatly combed.\n\nMy daddy not being a church going man except for the major holiday's, Easter, Mother's Day and Christmas, would go with mom, me and my 2 other siblings on Easter.  I remember listening to him sing along with this song and as I looked up at him I thought he had the best voice.  While he's now in his 80's and still not a church going man, it's one of my \"Precious Memories\".\n\nIt's not surprising that I purchased this song for my iPod to listen, along with several of the other old hymns offered on this CD.  I listen to them on my commute in the morning since I use public transportation and it helps to remind me of what really matters in life.\n\nAlan's deep voice resonates with a richness and respect that is missing in much of today's contemporary Christian music.  I can close my eyes and see the cross that I've held onto during the rough times and still hear my daddy's voice every Easter.\n\nIf you purchase one CD for your collection, make it this one.

            "Hellmann's has a great, tangy taste, and the consistency is the absolute best of any mayonnaise or salad dressing product I've ever used. I also like that it doesn't get those yellowish areas of color when it gets older and is exposed to the air like other products do. I won't use anything else on my sandwiches, and I say that as someone who really is NOT into brand loyalty at all. Hellmann's is one of the few products I make sure I buy the brand name of.\n\nI was turned on to Hellmann's years ago thanks to some take-out packets from a local deli, and I've been using it ever since. I grew up with Miracle Whip in the house as a kid, and then using store brands of mayo when I was living on my own, and would never have bought the more expensive brand name otherwise. Nowadays, the price point is very good; the store brands here (Kroger) are only about 60 cents cheaper, and it's just not worth it.\n\nMy only quibble is this new packaging, which really blows. The squeezing works fine but this clear plastic lid/overlay is rotten. The older blue plastic lids with hinges weren't great, because the hinge would break so easily after being opened and closed several times. This new clear plastic overlay is just the pits, though. We've used three bottles with this overlay so far and in every single one, it's cracked after very little use, and it's pretty sharp when it's broken, making it a potentially painful experience just trying to open the bottle. We've taken to ripping that clear plastic part off as soon as it cracks and covering the bottle with saran wrap and a rubber band instead!\n\nLike I said, this is one of the few brands I actively seek out to purchase -- but this new lid is testing my brand loyalty.",

            "Picture quality looks great scanned in high definition compared to the standard DVD releases but there are audio issues with the DTS-MA 5.1 audio beginning with the first episode \"Brother's Keeper\" there are several scenes where the audio sync is off 10-15 frames. I know there was a lot ADR dubbing in places which are also evident on the DVD but comparing it to the DVD release it's noticeably worse.  Also the second episode \"Heart of Darkness\" the audio is 180 degrees out of phase and sounds hollow and has a strange echo/reverb effect on certain scenes.  The 5.1 Dolby mix on the DVD sounds better.  Also the episode \"Home Invaders\" would not play DTS-MA audio and can only play Dolby 2.0 stereo only.  \"Evan\" has out of phase audio with echo/reverb distortion on the DTS-MA audio but sounds fine on the Dolby 2.0 stereo mix.  I have sent an e-mail to Mill Creek Entertainment bringing these issues to their attention in hopes that they will fix the issues and offer corrected replacement discs.\n\n10/13/16 - Mill Creek has responded to my inquiry and have forwarded my concerns to their production and manufacturing team to investigate the audio issues and will contact me when they have determined the best course of action should they offer replacement discs so there is hope they will fix this!\n\nUPDATE: 10/31/16 - Mill Creek has responded to address the audio problems.  They will be sending out corrected replacement discs! Here is the e-mail they just sent out:\n\n\"To our customers and fans of Miami Vice, we thank you for your patronage and passionate responses to the Miami Vice - Complete Series release on Blu-ray. We appreciate the messages we have received and have been following on forums and social media. We have investigated and reviewed the issues found, debated, and discussed. We hope we can provide answers and clarity because we want fans to be able to enjoy this landmark TV series to its fullest.\n\n  Aspect Ratio\no  It has always been our intention to release the series in its original, full screen aspect ratio which is how the HD masters were provided to us.\n\n  Packaging\no  Based on customer feedback, we chose to package this product using standard Blu-ray cases inside a slipcase instead of packaging using cardboard sleeves. Unfortunately, we cannot control how our resellers re-package and ship direct-to-consumer, so for any consumers receiving damaged product from shipping, please notify the retailer directly.\n\n  Audio Sync\no  The audio throughout the series is in sync as on the masters provided. For those moments questioned, they are a result of dubbing (ADR) from the production of the show. We have been unable to identify any occurrence of asynchronous audio as a result of our authoring of the episodes. We have concluded that the issues are more noticeable now than in previous DVD releases due to the uncompressed DTS-HD Master Audio and HD video which cause these slight imperfections to become much more audible than ever before. This also affects the dynamic range in the audio during scenes where background audio may also become more noticeable. This will vary by individual home audio systems, setups, and personalized audio settings.\n\n  5.1 Audio\no  We have re-QCed each and every episode across all five seasons and have identified the following 4 episodes in Season 1 which have errors with the new 5.1 lossless audio:\n\nHeart of Darkness\n  The 5.1 audio track does have issues in the mix creating an echo/reverb-like effect that phases in and out periodically throughout the episode.\n\nThe Home Invaders\n\"Nobody Lives Forever\"\n  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio tracks were accidentally left-off the disc after we conducted the original QC\n\nEvan\n  The 5.1 audio track does have issues in the mix creating an echo/reverb-like effect that phases in and out periodically throughout the episode.\n\nWe apologize for these errors and are fully prepared to fix the issues in Season 1 on Discs 1 and 4 of the Blu-ray Complete Series set.  We will send disc replacements out to customers who contact us and provide us with proof of purchase.  It will take several weeks for replacement discs to become available, so we appreciate your patience as we work to resolve these errors.\"\n\nBravo, Mill Creek, for taking responsibility and fixing the audio problems.",

            "Another great Demonsouled novel that takes up right where first novel left off.  Mazael Cravenlock, now a lord, tries to keep the peace between two of the most powerful lords of the land (his liege lord, Richard Mandragon, and his original benefactor, Lord Malden Roland) while demonsouled and San-Keth snake people have their own plans for domination.  Mazael must conquer these external conflicts while still resisting the call of his own demonsouled blood.  Second novel continues the same tradition and style as the first novel.  Mazael shows character growth with better understanding of how he must cope with being both demonsouled and a lord.  Villains become stronger and their plots more intricate and diabolical.  Overall this is another dark and bloody story which is pretty good if you like those types of stories.  Author's website is titled \"Jonathan Moeller, Pulp Writer\" which gives some indication of his writing style.\n\nThis is the second book in a series.

            "{Full review below but if you think this is all about shuffling zombies ripping into human flesh, think again it is a doggone good story about betrayal, learning to enjoy life and some really zany character interaction.}\n\nBOOK SYNOPSIS FROM GOODREADS\nFrom the beginning of Figg's employment, there is something not quite right about the bar. There are few customers, a parade of neighborhood psychics and pentacle adorned visitors, all coming to hold court with her enigmatic boss. Figg is not sure what is going on, but she is determined to find out!\n\nWhen the local voodoo queen shows up, and the next morning her grandson ends up dead outside the bar things get interesting.\n\nFigg pesters Lian into telling her the truth about his former life, and is thrust into a world where the things that go bump in the night are real. There's a murder to solve, zombies to lay to rest and a villain that neither of them saw coming.\n\nRead the first chapter at Stephany's blog\n\nMY THOUGHTS\n\nMy first thought when I read the word Zombies was ick as not really into reading Zombie stories. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I was treated to a very entertaining story that includes murder, magic, voodoo rituals, a bit of steamy romance, family disputes and some revelations about the main characters that will leave you with your mouth hanging open. This story is written in alternating points of view as seen through the eyes of Figg and Lian, not my favorite writing style but have to tell you it works great with this tale. Once you sit down and get through a few chapters you do not even notice because you are too interested in what happens next. For a story that is only a little over 100 pages you get a huge experience. Hopefully we will soon be reading more adventures with Figg and Lian and maybe even Carl and Boyd!\n\n[For the purposes of full disclosure I downloaded this copy free using the coupon code provided by the author.

He's beat me several times too!\n\nThis is really a simple card trading game based on trading higher numbered card for lower numbered cards.  In fact, a conventional deck of playing cards could be adapted to playing this game at a very basic level, but the addition of special \"power cards\" adds fun and randomness to the game play, and there is a memory building angle as well, so you really get everything a game should be in one package: strategy, random luck of the draw, and a bit of genuine gambling.  Then there's the entertainment value of the really cool rat and cat cartoons on the cards.\n\nSo, if you are at the end of your rope for game night with the kids, spend a few bucks and try this one.  It looks like it's going to have nine lives in my family.",

            "Lewis deals with a timeless issue in this book: why is there suffering and pain? In the UK, this issue has come centre stage in moral debates. Should a being being permitted to exist if its life is destined to be one of \"useless\" suffering.\n\nThere was an article in the paper about a year ago about a couple who had a child with cystic fibrosis and wanted through IVF to conceive a child free of this nasty disease. Through the \"miracle\" of science, they were enabled to screen out any embryos with the disease so that they could have a \"perfect\" child. The logic for this was, so they said: \"why would anyone want anyone to suffer\" (aside: what would their existing child with CF be now thinking: it would have been better that I had not existed?) as if all who suffer, would wish not to be rather than to be. This kind of thinking is becoming indemic. It is a rejection of the truth which shines forth luminously from every human being, a truth which causes the beholder to say: \"It is indeed wonderful that you exist\"\n\nAnd, this is where Lewis comes in with an attempt at answering the question of: \"why is there suffering\"?:\n\n\"The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of a God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word \"love\", and look on things as if man were the centre of them. Man is not the centre, God does not exist for the sake of man. Man does not exist for his own sake\".\n\nThus, love has become associated with a soft type of sentimentality in our culture; but it is much greater than that: it actively seeks for the good of the person loved - love may thus permit suffering to enable the person loved to become a person, who is himself capable of self emptying love. Lewis notes: \"We are not merely imperfect creatures who must be improved; we are, as Newman said, rebels who must lay down our arms\".\n\nLewis does not shrink from giving suffering its due: \"No doubt pain as God's megaphone is a terrible instrument; it may lead to final and unrepented rebellion. But it gives the only opportunity the bad man can have for amendment. It removes the view; it plants the flag of truh within the fortress of a rebel soul\"\n\nIn a word, suffering destroys our self delusion that we are in control, that we are demi-gods: when we suffer, we know where we are and its not at the centre of the universe.\n\nThus, whilst suffering (be it physical, natural or emotional), is an effect of evil, being a privation of the good, it can lead us to a recognition of our creaturely place in the universe and hence to find out true \"orientation\".\n\nOn hell, Lewis states; \"I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside\"\n\nLewis is very good indeed in this book; he synthesises brillianty key christian doctrines coherently and intelligibly.\n\nBrilliant!",

Yes, it's stinky - hey, it's krill.  Krill is shrimp and that spells stinky when dried and by the way, cats LOVE stinky, fishy smells.  The bottom line is if you happen to have finicky felines, this is a great additive.  What I do is take a tablespoon and put it in a paper towel, fold it over and over until I've got a little bundle, then I pinch it all over so the shrimps break up into a powder.  I put enough fish flavored wet food in a bowl to feed all of them, add the powdered krill to that mix, divvy it up into smaller bowls amongst the hoard and watch them lap it up.  Yep, does the trick.  I purchased the smaller can because I wanted to try it out first, but when the time comes, I'll be graduating to the large one.",

            "These die cast models are perfect for fans of the Back To The Future series.

It DOES contain the connecting pole and hook, which you should find taped to the bottom of the platform in the box it comes in, should you decide to take it out of it's box to display it. The differences between this model and the other two are that the second movie's version DeLorean has a Mr Fusion unit instead of the pole and hook, and the 3rd has the modified components on the front bonnet, as well as the 1950's wheels.\n\nThese are excellent die cast models, the doors open up, and the wheels spin. But that's all it does. Do not expecting anything else, no lights, sounds or anything else extra. What you see is pretty much what you get, inside a box with a pictured background from the movie it represents.\n\nI just wish this same company had released a second version of the BTTF II DeLorean with the wheels folded out in flight mode.

            "Starring Johnny Depp, this story is based on the life of George Jung, a drug dealer who made millions of dollars in the 1970s and is now serving a long prison sentence. As a young man, George goes to California and teams up with a flamboyant gay hairdresser, played by Paul Reubens, to sell marijuana. After a short prison sentence where he meets Jordi Molla, a Colombian drug dealer, he graduates to cocaine. All this is done with relative ease against a background of the exaggerated hairstyles and clothing that seem like artificial props. His first girlfriend, Franka Potente is a stewardess who helps him get started by smuggling marijuana in her travel bag; his second girlfriend, Penelope Cruz is enamoured by his money. All of this casting is excellent and the craziness that was the 70s comes through loud and clear.\nI liked the cinematography. The period of the 1950s was shot in an over-exposed brightness. And there were quick snapshot montages which were well done. The action moved quickly and I was intrigued throughout although the presence of Ray Liotta, cast as George's father, kept reminding me of \"Goodfellas\" which was a much better film. It is hard to relate to the Johnny Depp character however. His life was a tragedy but yet he seemed shallow. Perhaps this is by design because the writers did not want to glorify a drug dealer. It did glorify the money though, and the high-living lifestyle that it brought even though it blew away just like everything else. Even though I wasn't deeply moved, I do recommend this film. The moral is that crime doesn't pay, although we do see some of the fun along the way.",

            "These are simple yet elegant Thank You Cards. I am always writing thank you notes for friends, family and business associates. When I was offered these simple thank you cards at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review, I was happy to do just that. These cards arrived on time and in a nice clear, solid package. There were 12 Thank You cards, blank inside, made out of a premium grade linen cardstock. These are definitely not your average Thank You cards. I was very impressed with the high grade of cardstock used to make these cards and the envelopes were quality made as well, they had a peel off tab to seal them shut. A quality I always look for when buying cards, it seems so old-fashioned, not to mention unsanitary to lick an envelope shut! I am very please with the quality of these cards and will definitely put them to good use. Never underestimate the power of a thoughtful, well written & hand written Thank You note. It's an extra added touch that shows you took the time out to write the card, therefore, you really care. I would definitely buy these again. In fact, there was a Thank You note included with these cards thanking me for my purchase and a coupon code to use at the website for an 18% discount and free shipping on my future purchase. Now that is something I can appreciate. A very thoughtful gesture.",

            "Jim Steinman's music has always been about power and passion on an almost operatic scale. He likes to tell stories within his songs;and while he may not have a trained voice like Meatloaf's,Steinman knows how to let the  theatrics shine through in his singing. BAD FOR GOOD came about simply  because Jim had a load of great material,and Meatloaf wasn't available. This  is the ultimate Steinman production:thunderous rock,sweeping orchestra,and  background harmonies crashing against it all like waves against a cliff  face. Dazzling in it's beauty, frightening in it's power. This album stands  the test of time,and yet I can't help thinking that Steinman was never  happy with the finished product. The proof of this are the re-recorded  versions of many of these songs by Steinman and Meatloaf on BAT OUT OF HELL  II.",

            "One cannot help but feel a certain pity or sympathy for Sonny, the hapless protagonist of 'Dog Day Afternoon'. This is certainly no cut-throat villian, simply a luckless down and outer trying to make one big score to put a little daylight between himself and the small time life he leads.\n\nThe amateurish heist that Sonny and his cohort Sal try to pull quickly becomes a media circus and ends up being a large scale parallel of Sonny's existence in general. His life is a struggle against a society that wants to bring him down, and here he is up against a police force that is determined to do the same. Although the character Sonny has a slightly comical side to him, his partner Sal is quite different. His serious nature sometimes borders on sinister and is the quality that lends the film much of it's edge. Of the two main characters he seems like the one who is much more likely to snap and put his gun to use.\n\nAfter Sonny and Sal have established some sort of a rapport with the girls who work in the bank, the movie takes on a more relaxed, benevolent feel. This allows for a certain charm in the film that would not have appeared possible at the outset.\n\n'Dog Day Afternoon' ends up being a strange but fantastic mix of gun-slinging tension and oddball charm, that has it's rightful place in film history and creates an interesting new twist in the crime genre.",

Whether or not it is enough to bother you depends on the person.

It works well in our son's room, but not well in our room. Our room suffers from a cold draft at the moment and having the humidifier set on anything other than HIGH seems to be inadequate.\nThe digital humidity level gauge is a real plus.

            "I mostly burst into flames at the beach, so when my girlfriend suggested we get something like this for the upcoming family beach day, I was relieved and immediately ordered it from Amazon.  It arrived on time (as usual), and we did a dry run in the back yard.  I figured that was better than breaking up in front of her family at the beach if it were really hard to put together.  One pass over the instructions -  which are cleverly attached to the case so they can't be lost - and I was on my way.  It probably too me ten minutes the first time, but it wasn't that difficult at all.  The most difficult part was putting it back in the case.  But we all know that these things never go back in there the way they were.\n\nBeach day came a couple of days later and it was time for the true test.  I was worried about the stakes not staying in the beach sand, but they performed fine.  It was a little tougher to assemble on the beach than it had been in the back yard due to the wind and sand, but I had experience on my side and it was up in no time.  We convinced the kids that filling the included sand bags was a game, so that pretty much took care of itself.  I did end up spilling one of the sand bags inside of the shade.  I wish the drawstrings had some kind of tension closure.  I think next time I'll bring Ziploc bags to put inside of the sandbags.  Or I could just be more careful.  There were other variants of this nearby on the beach, so I got to watch their experience.  They mostly went up faster, but seemed to not store as compactly.  They also either did not offer as much coverage, or didn't have the complete zip up feature like the Coleman did.  I ended up changing inside of this one which was a neat feature.  The kids enjoyed getting inside and zipping it up also.  Though, out in the sun it got very hot very quickly with the zipper closed.\n\nI can see how the wind could be an issue, .but if you open the back window it seems to pass through.  Overall the shade was awesome and just what I needed.  Almost everyone ended up in it at some point.  One of the kids took a nap in it (when the others weren't using it as a beach fort).  My girlfriend took a nap in it, I spent much of my time avoiding spontaneous combustion in there.  It did fill up with sand pretty easily, but it's the beach... what are ya gonna do?\n\nI have four improvements that it could use:\n1. Two more stakes to hold the front flap down - I'll probably end up buying some because i didn't like that it was just loose.\n2. The lack of side windows made it a little isolating when inside the shade\n3. The guides for the poles are mesh which makes them hard to thread the poles through (though  I can see some benefit of mesh)\n4. Sandbags that seal better\n\nAll of these are minor, and this is an awesome product.",

            "In retrospect, it seems almost strange that SOS first album and only massively popular single are the stuff of Pop idealism...there is little of the brooding melancholia  and even less of the traditional lounge jazz that  typify most of their later recordings.  That's not to say this album  doesn't offer significant Pop pleasures, which it does with a nod and a  wink.  As the only album to feature crisp rock drumming by Martin Jackson,  it's also the only album by SOS that truly sounded contemporary upon  release.  The synthesizer washes and sharp production help to propel the  music, even when the actual tempo isn't all that brisk.  As a result,  \"It's Better...\" is SOS most spirited effort, and catches them at  their most optimistic moment, their \"breakout,\" if you'll pardon  the pun. \"Fooled By A Smile,\" \"Breakout,\" and  \"Blue Mood\" are classy, catchy Pop music of the first order.  \"It's Not Enough\" and \"Surrender\" take longer to sink  in, but offer their own unique pleasures as well.  \"After Hours\"  is a giggly simulation of the jazz to come, no less endearing for all the  synthetic accompaniment.  \"Twilight World\" is little more than  mood music, and was a poor choice for a follup single in the U.S.  \"Communion\" has a gorgeous minor key melody that lends a wistful  air to the album.  The only lackluster contribution to this album is the  overlong instrumental \"Theme...\", which lumbers around with the  delicacy of Godzilla on a day trip to Tokyo.  The CD release of this album  includes some alternative mixes, which will really only please diehard  fans, and will probably sound a little goofy/silly to non-fans.\nThrough  the promotional music videos (and, to a lesser extent, through the music  itself) you get a feel for SOS as a real group, not the duo backed by  studio sessionmen they later became. The happy to thoughtful to happy moods  of this album represent an optimism and pure zest for melody that are sadly  lacking in later releases. If you want to catch SOS at their most  snappingly upbeat, I heartily recommend this album.",

            "This movie is one of the most gripping and riveting movies I have ever seen. I know some people say it is hogwash  due to the military coverup aspect. However, to think Oswald was the lone gunman in the Kennedy assassination is being very nave. Not even the best marksman with far superior weapons could get off the number of shots Oswald supposedly did in that amount of time using a bolt action rifle, let alone score two head shots ( one in the throat and the other in the head). But I do not want to concentrate on that point but the movie. The acting was superb from all the actors which included: John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, and of  course Kevin Costner. This is a must see movie that will appeal to a broad audience. Even though it runs for approximately 3   hours it keeps you fixated to the screen. The video transfer to DVD was superb and the 5.1 Dolby was quite good., I would have liked to see the rear channels utilized a bit more but the subwoofer, main speakers, and center channel were will utilized. Dialog is focused on the center channel and is easy to hear even at low volume settings.

            "Beethoven's Eighth is another of the more obscure symphonies of the nine he wrote. Most likely overshadowed by both the Seventh (which was enormously popular in Beethoven's lifetime) and the miraculous Ninth, the Eighth is sandwiched helplessly between two monoliths of music history. This is too bad, because the Eighth has its own merits, though it will probably never be counted amongst his \"greatest\" works.\nIt's also a relatively short one, and it doesn't exude the popular \"storm and strife\" of Beethoven's most popular works (it's considered to be amongst his 'happier' symphonies - whatever that means).\nIt was written in 1812 but did not premiere until 1814. This was around the time Beethoven wrote the very overly-analyzed and romanticized \"Eternal Beloved\" letter. There's not much for sappy historians here. You won't find Beethoven's pining love or passionately broken heart stuck on a barbed wire fence in the Eighth. It seems as though Beethoven was up to something different in the Eighth. Some glances of humor show through.\nThe first movement explodes into music from the first note. There is no introduction or fade up of any kind. Suddenly the listener drowns and thrashes about in a wave of notes. And of course anyone who has read three lines about this piece knows that the second movement may possibly could be there's a chance it's dedicated to the inventor of the metronome, which explains the 'tick-tock' beginning. Who knows? It's a good story nonetheless.\nThis is an excellent recording of the Eighth. It's powerful where it needs to be and sprightly where it should be. Due to the nature of the work, and some of Beethoven's comments about it (the CD booklet claims that he thought it was much better than the Seventh), this could be one of the harder Beethoven symphonies to pull off in both interpretation and performance. Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic pull off something great.",

            "First off, net metal reviewers, can we please stop throwing \"Nu\" around needlessly when you really just want to say an album is well produced?  Its like you would have us believe Fred Durst will suddenly step from behind Tim Calvert's cabinet and drop some mad rhymes mid-solo.  \"Nu\" does not belong anywhere near ANY record in Forbidden's catalog.  And while yes, there are some distorted vocals and guitar squeals, there are also raging melodic solos, and quite frankly, King Crimson was doing the distorted vocals thing in 1969 with \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" well before most of the guys in Korn were even born.\n\nThis album is classic  prog-thrash with 90s attitude, well-produced, four-to-the-floor NASTY.  Since they are second-generation San Fran thrash, this band is a bit more obscure than even Death Angel or Violence standards, strictly a cult thing, but ask any real bay area veteran and you will be schooled.  In contrast to the first album fans, whose haste to condemn them is alarming for having a little fun (\"Over the Middle\"), let me assure those of you who have heard bad things about _Green_ that Forbidden is here on serious business on this, their swansong.  And they go down swinging. The entire album generally shows confidence, band chemistry and mature songwriting than the wildly uneven _Distortion_.  _Green_ has many highlights, with typical searing guitar from Locicero and Calvert, as well as excellent, melodic but throaty vocal work from Russ Anderson, starting with the psychadelic opener \"Last Time.\"  The album reaches an early, speedy apex with the ravenous \"Face-Down Heroes,\" which starts its rhythm from a phone busy-reorder sample and just gets deadlier as the song continues.  The next stretch of songs starts to get a little samey, \"pHat\" and \"Noncent$\" continuing the political/environmental themes while \"Blank\" sees Forbidden try a somewhat novel (for them, anyways) \"ballad\"-like approach.  But the awesome, psychadelic eastern-tinged album closer \"Focus\" is a song dark and mysterious enough to make Maynard from Tool's tiny little arm hairs stand up at attention.  Great underrated and neglected semi-masterpiece, perhaps the highlight of their catalog.",

You download the app, launch it, login to your account, and it's up and running.  For a mac, it just downloads the app directly to your machine, and you can run the installer.\n\nMost people with computers know what the norton suite traditionally does.  Mainly virus prevention and removal.  But it does something completely different for mobile devices.  First, it has \"anti-theft\" features.  You login to your same online norton account, and from there you can locate your device (brings up a map and shows you where it is), or lets you \"scream\" (make a loud alarm sound to scare the would-be thief).  It also lets you backup your contacts.\n\nAlso when you launch the app on Android it lets you run a malware scan, which also reports \"privacy risks\", which is actually kind of cool in that it tells you what information certain apps are collecting.\n\nOverall I think this is a good product.  If you have a computer you really should be getting some sort of protection like this anyway, and if you also have mobile devices this is kind of a no-brainer.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because the installation is kind of baffling and overly complicated, and in the case of Apple mobile devices, the features that find your phone or send messages etc are superflous because those features already exist as part of \"icloud\" which you get for free.",

            "It took what seemed like forever, but Sony Music has started to release 5.1-channel SACDs.  Billy Joel's \"The Stranger\" is one of the first.  The multichannel version has catalog number CS 69384.\nThe disc is presented in 5.1 channel packed DSD sound as well as stereo DSD.  There is no CD layer, so the SACD is only playable in an SACD player.  Multichannel requires a multichannel SACD player such as the Sony SCD-CE775.\nUnlike early DVD-Audio discs, the mixes and mastering process on this early multichannel SACD are all excellent.  The vocals are extremely clear and the disc is easy to use.  Unlike a DVD-Audio disc, which acts like a glorified DVD-Video disc, a multichannel SACD acts like a CD.  Press 'play' - it plays.  Track skipping is easy.  As a bonus, the name of each track appears on the player's built-in display - no video display required.\nStandout tracks are \"Moving Out\" where the vocals are full and extremely clean sounding.  The low bass on \"Just the Way you Are\" is excellent and warm.  There are no use of instruments that \"fly\" throughout the channels, just a very good mix.\nI'm on my fifth play now of this disc.  An excellent start to the world of multichannel SACD.  May there be many more discs like this.\nNote : Earlier SACD versions of \"The Stranger\" were stereo-only.",

            "Anita Shreve specializes in novels about families under pressure. Themes of love and loss, momentary incidents that change lives forever, and broken promises thread through all her novels, and Rescue is no exception. Peter Webster is a helper, a man who is driven to rescue others, and what better occupation for that than EMT? As a young man, he falls in love with the victim of a car accident, and while he and Sheila could not be more different, they marry and have a child, a daughter named Rowan. Peter is the salt of the earth, and Sheila a somewhat reckless party girl, and their marriage lasts no longer than would be expected, leaving him to bring up Rowan as a single father. Seventeen years later, Rowan is no longer Peter's innocent little girl, and he seeks out Sheila, wondering if she might be able to help their daughter see the error of her ways.\n\nRescue contains plenty of information about the life of EMTs, but remove all the accident scenes, and there's little left beyond the simple plot described above. As a story, it's interesting enough, but lacks the tension that drives most of Shreve's previous work. Strong on character, weak on plot, this is a novel for readers interested in relationships rather than action. To check out what this author can really do, read The Pilot's Wife.",

Il ne faut pas être astrophysicien pour savoir que le métal est assez conducteur en énergie. Donc, la température du métal sera équivalent à la température à l'eau qui le contient (donc max 100 °C). Ça peut piquer un peu si vous prenez la bouilloire à deux mains parce qu'elle est trop lourde pour la transporter à une main. Il faudra d'office la mettre hors d'atteinte des enfants en-dessous de 18 ans. J'ai déjà vu des bouilloires à 5 €, avec le même volume, la même résistance *et tout en plastique.

            "J'avais déjà une La Crosse Technology avant et c'est pour cette raison que j'ai acheté ce modèle : les émetteurs extérieurs sont les mêmes, donc je n'avais plus qu'à placer le nouveau dans l'emplacement collé au mur de l'ancien ! Niveau fonctionnalités, j'ai envie de dire qu'on a du basique : heure (qui se règle automatiquement), température IN/OUT avec mémoire des minimales et maximales. La connexion entre l'émetteur et la station se fait rapidement, tout comme le réglage de l'heure, RAS à ce niveau là ! Par contre au niveau de la prédiction météorologique, comme pour mon ancienne station, c'est pas bien fiable ! Ca rajoute un petit icône, c'est mignon, mais c'est pas bien utile ! Mon gros point négatif est sur l'esthétique de la station : on est sur un design dépassé, c'est moche... Le point positif : il s'agit d'une très bonne marque dont les produits sont robustes et s'il n'était pas compliqué pour moi d'installer un autre émetteur à l'extérieur, j'aurais certainement prix un autre modèle plus évolué de cette marque. Mon ancienne station a tenu plus de 5 ans, et du jour au lendemain, la connexion avec l'émetteur a commencé à dysfonctionner... En tous cas, si vous ne souhaitez pas y mettre un budget énorme et souhaitez quelque chose de fonctionnel, n'hésitez pas, ça reste un bon produit !",

            "Some Benchmade enthusiasts probably aren't going to like what I have to say, but I just don't feel this knife is worth what they charge for it. The 154cm steel is good, the blade shape is useful, it is nice and lightweight, but other than that I never grew to like this knife so I sold it. The good news is that is holds it value very well on the used market. Things I didn't like: well actually, the lock! Yes it is fun to flip open and closed but by design the only thing really holding it in the locked position are two small guitar string like springs. This is ok, unless you are doing some heavy cutting and then the shock applied from this can cause the lock to fail, as shown by a well known online knife vendors youtube review. Which is understandable if a knife lock fails this way, but the problem I had is if it does fail the design of this lock gives zero finger guard to stop the scary sharp blade from taking your fingers off. Luckily enough mine never failed, but it did have some blade play until I had to adjust it until the opening and closing wasn't very impressively smooth anymore. I suppose you could always wedge a stick or nail behind the lock mechanism prohibiting the blade from coming down when doing heavy cutting tasks. It is good to know you could always make your own replacement springs from an old guitar spring if you didn't want to mail your knife into Benchmade, too. But what I could not stand on this knife was how bad the plastic scales feel. Even the texturing adds to the super cheap feel, and a lot of the different texturing either adds no grip at all or is actually sharp on the back of your hand when grabbing things out of your pocket. Gripping the knife firmly causes the handles to flex and also feels cheap. The jimping on the blade does little to nothing for grip. I just wasn't impressed with the fit and finish on this knife, and the black pocket clips are awful and flake off their cheap paint immediately. They all need to be replaced with Benchmade's deep carry clip with either a blued/ parkerized finish or none at all since the cheap paint looks ugly after no time at all. If this knife was $50 I'd say go for it, but for less than half the price of the griptilian you could get a Kershaw Blur that I would much prefer to carry even if its steel may or may not be slightly inferior. Even the S30V blur is still about $15 cheaper than the griptilian. I'm sure there are many other options out there for $100 or less that are superior to the griptilian, so do your research before you pay out Benchmade prices.",

You do sink about 2 inches or so when you sit on the stool (i weigh 150 lbs) so they are not high quality air cylinders. on the bottom of the base, there is a \"plastic\" ring around to protect the floor. With it being plastic, they still can slide a little. Saying is a \"rubber\" ring is a stretch as you expect a rubber ring to be softer and contour to the floor a bit. Overall, i am happy with this purchase. i understand these aren't high quality stools for the price but they should work just fine. I will update my review in a month or 2 to see how they hold up.",

The vanilla and musk scent I pick up on I do like.  ROMA reminds me of something; then it hit me -- to me, it smells rather like a cologne a man would wear, not for a woman at all.  It has a spicy manly odor.\n\nI love a variety of scents -- some of my favorites include TABU, EMERAUDE, RED DOOR, WHITE DIAMONDS, and Dolce & Gabbana LIGHT BLUE.  I'm thinking ROMA will not fall into the category of one of my favorite colognes.\n\nI love the bottle it is in, a frosted pillar style certainly reminding one of Italy.  I also think the name ROMA reminds me of my favorite tomatoes instead of a women's fragrance.  It is 0.84 ounces in a spray bottle form.\n\nTo sum up, for me, this cologne is three star, just OK.  I would certainly not purchase it and probably will have to remind myself to wear it -- very sparingly.\n\nThank you.",

            "Clearly the greatest game of all time considering the generation it was released in. I actually bought the original game BEFORE I bought the Commodore 128. How many games can you say that about? I have never been able to capture the feeling I got from Pirates!, with any other game. The violence, the debauchery, the conquest; this game had it all. November 16th cannot come fast enough. Of all the games Sid Meier ever made, Pirates! was his crown jewel. Taking into consideration the graphics of Pirates of the Caribbean, Pirates! should be stunning. Without a doubt this game has the potential to ruin a lot of marriages and fail out a lot of students. It could even topple the original Pirates! as the greatest game ever.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI originally wrote a review on a game I did not play because I had faith in Sid Meier. I have played most of his games (including the original Pirates and Pirates Gold). I can only say that this game is a disappointment. Although sea battles are good they are a far cry from Pirates of the Caribbean or even Bethesda's High Seas. The \"special crew members\" you pick up are virtually worthless. You only have to hijack one of them and they are with you for life - they have no individual stats so they are all the same. Pirates of the Caribbean gave each guy individual stats and you paid for their improved performance, it made sense. You should be able to hire these guys at taverns or go on missions to find them; they are and should be pretty important to any successful ship captain.\n\nThe game play is repetitive (so was the original but it was 17 years ago!) He used the same descriptions in his instruction manual that he used 17 years ago Sid didn't even have the decency to change the verbage in the manual! I know I still have it along with the orignal game and the save disk I made for it. He also got rid of the 1560's era, a very challenging one I might add.\n\nDancing is a joke! I can do it, it is not a problem but you have to dance with your wife to get any information out of her. This is not the 1990's it is the 1690's. Women did what they were told! What a sell out!\n\nLets call this game what it is, a politically correct Pirates, you can't even buy tobacco! Are you nuts! Tobacco was a major new world export, I can understand cutting out slavery but tobacco. Why don't you just get rid of sugar and say we export Splendor or NutraSweet because sugar is bad for you! Just awful.\n\nNeedless to say I am profoundly disappointed with this game, I expected so much more. I have a high-end system so I have no problems with game play. Believe me after one battle you have seen it all. Very sad.\n\nBy the way. I was a big wit and charm guy in the original Pirates. I liked getting large happy crews of men to sack every place I could. What the hell does wit and charm do now? I still have to dance (even with my wife), I still have angry crewmembers. Shouldn't wit and charm make dancing easier or cut it out all together - now there is an advantage.\n\nThis is just a very poorly made game, they tried to take the original and beef it up with graphics. This didn't work for Star Wars and it doesn't work for Pirates! The title should have been Pirates?",

            "Signals is a very good album, but a slight momentum drop. That was bound to happen at some point. I'm quite sure there's not another band in rock whose first 8 studio albums either matched or exceeded the previous release in my mind, so that's a lot of momentum built up. Surely it was due to flag even (and only) slightly.\n\nClearly Subdivisions and New World Man are the radio staples and with good reason. Both are simply awesome tunes. Subdivisions is one of the best album openers in the catalog and is never a dull listen to me. I love the \"Subdivisions\" spoken word for some inexplicable reason. This song has got a lot of balls. The lyrics are great too. Who can't relate to this? New World Man has a great drive to it as well, led by Lee and Peart. Both are really dynamic songs and worth their respective air time.\n\nLosing It is another really tasty keyboard-driven tune featuring some touching lyrics and a wistful melody to match, as well as another sensational vocal performance from Geddy Lee. Seriously, the \"Rush ballad\" has been largely and unfortunately ignored for their more uptempo stuff and that's a damn shame. They really excel here. Most people probably don't even realize they've done slower songs. It's been fun reacquainting myself with this nugget.\n\nThe Analog Kid is a peppy uptempo rocker and I like it quite well.\n\nChemistry (nice bass groove to open the song) and Digital Man have their moments...and are generally good listens. But none of the rest of the album beyond the first three mentioned above really grabbed my attention fully throughout. I struggle to remember even a bit, riff or melody of The Weapon (pt. 2 of \"Fear\"). And Countdown, while cool with its NASA voice-overs and fx, is a bit on the dull side ultimately insofar as a full song goes. More interesting than re-listenable time and again.\n\nThe end result is very solid record and that's quite enough. Now that the band has turned a musical corner there's going to be some growth in this keys-driven sound.\n\nThe thing is that while I know a lot of old school Rush fans really got up in arms and screamed \"where did the guitars go??\", etc, I think the sound suited them. It didn't sound out of place, like Greg Allman doing 80s pop music (wasn't that a hoot?). It was a good marriage, even if it would prove to be too much at times. But in all fairness Rush was a bit too much at times anyhow....too much pomp and gratuitous and unharmonious weirdness at times. That didn't start with Moving Pictures.\n\nIn the end this band isn't perfect...but always professional and often (and unexpectedly) brilliant. Freakin' brilliant. And always moving, melding, and reshaping. You just have to always tune in to find those moments. Sometimes it's nearly a whole album's worth (Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures)...and other times it's two songs (Rush and Fly By Night). But even on those records that have only two songs worth, you're glad you tuned in. You can't NOT tune back in the next time around out of fear of missing something spectacular, because Rush is the band that fans sometimes like to consider down for the count - only to have them rebound mightily.\n\nI love that about this band.",

This product did not come in it's advertised \"retail packaging,\" but was new and never used.\n\nThe arm that connects to the phone bracket is notched and can be tightened to secure the arm in place.  Both the mount and the arm are made of metal and will likely not wear out during the use of this product.  Installing the product was beyond easy and the plate has a way to feed your charger cord so that it remains out of the way.\n\nInserting and removing the phone from the mount is not as easy as I'd like.  The ball joint that holds the phone bracket is not as snug as I'd like it to be; when attempting to insert the phone, the mounting plate will move out of position and require readjustment after inserting your phone.  In addition, while driving the plate as a tendency to move around a little bit; not enough for me to consider it a defective product, but I figure that this will ultimately be a point of failure over time that will warrant it's replacement.  The plastic plate and cup that holds the arm to the plate are both made of plastic, unlike the ball and arm which are made of metal.  In addition, the instructions aren't as clear as I would like; there were 3 sets of \"fingers\" to hold the phone; with two looking the same and one pair that were longer than the others.  The instructions made no mention of this third pair; I figured it was for larger phones and am currently using them for my Nexus S.  Without using them, I would have to extend the bracket to near maximum length in order to hold my phone.  The arms also obstruct the 3.5mm TRS connector on the bottom of my phone.  I use a bluetooth connection to interface with my car so this is not a problem for me, but it would have been in my previous vehicle which had an auxilary in plug on my radio's faceplate.

            "Una película de mejor envoltorio que contenido. Aún así, comparada con otras de un género similar, la cinta de Michael Mann supera la media gracias a su estilo tan personal y reconocible. \nNo sé dónde escuché o leí que la manera en la que Michael Mann rueda sus escenas de acción es de lo más verosímil. Y lo cierto es que, si echamos un vistazo a Heat o a Collateral, sus dos cintas más equiparables con Corrupción en Miami en este sentido, podríamos convenir que sus balas y tiroteos sí que parecen sonar, y desarrollarse, como los de verdad. En ellos no hay rastro de esa exageración tan propia del cine por la que se puede disparar una escopeta de cañón recortado a una mano sin que a su portador le tiemble el pulso, o aquella otra por la que las balas de los malos sólo les refrescan el cogote a unos oponentes imprudentes en sus acciones. Además, sus guiones para este tipo de trabajos tampoco suelen adscribirse a las convenciones propias de las cintas de acción. Heat se podría casi considerar un western urbano planteado como un pulso entre dos colosos como De Niro y Pacino. Y el argumento de Collateral es más atípico incluso: Tom Cruise, un asesino a sueldo, y Jamie Foxx, un taxista, coinciden en el vehículo de éste en una noche de gran ajetreo laboral para el primero. Sin embargo, los guiones de ambas superan con creces la plana y poco original historia de esta Corrupción en Miami, basada en los personajes de la serie de los 80 de la que el propio Mann fue productor ejecutivo. Eso sí, al margen de haber empleado los nombres de los agentes ?Sonny? Crockett y Ricardo Tubbs y el título de la propia serie, esta cinta poco o nada tiene que ver con la producción televisiva creada por Anthony Yerkovich.Y ya no sólo porque la estética de Mann difumine cualquier paralelismo posible con la serie, con la que sólo comparte el lujo de los ambientes de Miami, sino porque se ve muy poco de Miami y, aún menos, del retratado en una serie que quizá, vista ahora, pudiera ya parecernos un pelín casposa, pese a lo aclamada que resultó en aquellos años. Por tanto, de esta libre adaptación que Mann ha hecho sobresale su peculiar fotografía nocturna, con un marcado grano en pantalla que ya pudimos disfrutar en Collateral, cinta en la que Mann comenzó a experimentar con el uso de las técnicas digitales, y con las posibilidades adicionales brindadas por éstas para el rodaje de escenas nocturnas. Así, algunas panorámicas de Miami rodadas en noche cerrada ofrecen una belleza centelleante. También es reseñable la escasa acción de la cinta, concentrada al final de su extenso metraje (casi dos horas y media), que sí lleva esa rúbrica tan particular de Mann de la que hablaba al principio. Pero lo que falla en ella, a mi juicio, es lo que ocurre en su nudo. Su historia quiere centrarse en cómo se desarrolla la infiltración de dos policías en una imbricada red criminal dotada de potentes herramientas de contraespionaje. Además de detallar las complejidades de una misión de este calibre, Mann profundiza en cómo la segunda identidad del agente puede, a veces, contaminar a la verdadera. Pero el desarrollo de toda esta trama, la verdad, resulta lento y, por momentos, mal explicado. De hecho, la cinta comienza con la muerte de dos agentes infiltrados de un cuerpo policial distinto al de Sonny y Tubbs debido a un chivatazo procedente de una de las agencias de seguridad implicadas. Pues bien, en el desenlace, después de que los dos policías de Miami retomen el trabajo de sus compañeros caídos, no queda resuelto el preocupante asunto del chivatazo.De la labor actoral, Colin Farrell convence como el carismático Sonny, Foxx se muestra eficaz como el cerebral ?Rico?, sorprende en sus contadas apariciones Luis Tosar como un malo contenido, al igual que destaca la sensual presencia de la bella Gong Li. Y la elección musical resulta acertada para acompañar las secuencias nocturnas por Miami o las localizaciones de Haití y Cuba.En definitiva, una película de mejor envoltorio que contenido. Aún así, comparada con otras de un género similar, la cinta de Michael Mann supera la media gracias a su estilo tan personal y reconocible. Pero su historia ya la han contado otras muchas veces e, incluso, mejor que aquí. Por citar algunos ejemplos, infinitamente mejores son las cintas policiacas basadas en guiones de James Ellroy. ",

            "Home Fries is a movie that tries to be two things, a chick flick romance flick between a heavily pregnant Drew Barrymore with red curly hair (supposed to be a certain real world fast food mascot maybe) and a new employee (Luke Wilson) who has started at the rural highway fast food joint she has been forced to work the drive thru at so no one can see her belly (yep it's a classy joint).  The other thing it tries to be is a quirky dark comedy where Luke Wilson only wanted to scare his step father (the guy who unbeknownst to them got Barrymore's character pregnant) but due to his psychopathic brother is now an accomplice to murder.  These sons trying to please their evil mother know there was a cross broadcast between what they spoke into their headsets worn during the murder and someone else.  They are determined to track down those other people and quickly suspect the fast food workers.  Wilson's character will go undercover to find out what they know. Meanwhile while he is working at the fast food joint, trying to please his mother, the psychopathic brother (played by Jake Busey) is trying to find out who his step father was having an affair with and is determined to kill her.\n\nAlthough it's entertaining enough and does have some good sight gags, and funny lines, the dark humour angle of the movie falls a bit short compared to other serial killer character blending into the real world type dark comedies of the late 90's such as The Big Hit.  Now I'm not a big romantic film watcher but that side of things just seemed a bit unrealistic to me.  A heavily pregnant woman still working in fast food in her late 30s who still lives with her mother and will be a huge financial burden, doesn't seem like much of a catch to a guy who's a pilot whose only quality time he's spent with her is consoling her while she's crying.  I could see the attraction from her point of view, especially with the better life that would bring for her and the kid but it just didn't seem plausible the other way round, especially when he learns who the biological father is.\n\nThe movie probably would have worked better if it was just trying to be a dark comedy, if it had given more screen time to the psychopath brother and their mother rather than trying to force a romance part of the script that just didn't really work.  I would have also liked to have seen more of Roy (Daryl Mitchell) the fast food guy who was training Luke Wilson's character and was alpha employee of the fast food workers. Wilson's character was a nice guy with a conscience who didn't like his brother's killing so still could have tried to hide Barrymore's character's identity as the mistress from his family and protected her as a friend or an innocent person and the overall storyline still would have worked, but been more plausible.",

Or use them to download DTD, It's What It Is, ENY House, and East MC's from his other albums.\n\nAs an album, I think it's MK's weakest. I have no problem w/ the fact that he's pursuing a different sound and doesn't have any Wu features. I think MK can stand on his own two feet, and I like his style. He really shines on those 4 tracks I mentioned.\n\nThe problem is that there are only a couple other actual songs, and those didn't do much for me, and once you subtract a couple of skit-type tracks and a few forgettable spoken word tracks, there's really not enough on here to justify calling it an album. Compare to the number of actual songs (i.e., with rap verses) on, say, Wu-Block or, again, Czarface.\n\nI'm saying, if Killa's gonna call this an album and expect my $10 (which he got), he needs to deliver at least 10-15 actual rap songs.",

When he was 7 years old  Limon's family fled to the United States.\n Although he spent most of his life in the United States  his early years in the midst of the Mexican Revolution deeply marked him. War and conflict are dominant themes in many of his works  including \"Missa Brevis.\"\n As a young man  he moved to New York to study painting but fell in love with dance  founding his own company after serving in World War II. He pioneered a dramatic  narrative-driven choreography style and was among the first to push male dancers to center stage.

My frustration comes from the fact that when they mastered this album for CD they didn't get the speed/pitch exactly right--the CD is about a quarter-tone flat (or more) from the original recording, which makes the tempos drag and her voice sound darker than it really is.  (It is not that my turntable runs too fast, folks--I've timed it and it's running correctly.)  Sigh, this happens sometimes when not enough care is taken in the CD mastering of something.\n\nUPDATE as of Aug 6, 2011:  SONY has remastered this album at the correct speed!!  It's available from Sony and shipped from Japan, but it is well worth it! I pre-ordered my copy, which arrived this week, and WOW what a great mastering job, and at the right speed with the pitch completely accurate.  I'm in heaven listening to it!!",
            "For the untrained Clive Barker reader, Abarat will seem like a vivid dream, an elaborate creation, a thing of wonder and beauty to be praised and revered.  To the serious Clive Barker reader, it amounts to the PG-13 version of Weaveworld and imajica combined.  Clive has taken to the all-ages genre and created a series that is sure to make him richer than he already is, but he's not doing anything new and that is very frustrating for the Constant Reader.  Abarat is a story about Candy Quackenbush who lives in the dullsville town of Chickentown, Minnesota.  She is an outcast, an exile, and she can't wait to get away.  Well...as you guessed, adventure finds her and she winds up in The Abarat, a series of islands in the nether world each dedicated to a certain our of the day or night.  Yawn.  Very formulaic for Barker.  This is Clive on cruise control.  This is Clive on auto-pilot.  This is Clive writing for the sake of writing, being weird for the sake of nothing better to do.  Clive Barker is good at being outlandish and strange and thinking up attorcities and oddities is his modus operendi.  Get a clue.  This is nothing new.\n\nDeal with it!",

At the time I thought - \"this will be great - she seems to enjoy stories like Mr Brown Can Moo - and it would be fun to hear other voices make the animals sounds ocassionally, in addition to reading the other fun stories with music and sounds.  Well, I was somewhat disappointed.  Please keep in mind that my daughter absolutely LOVES books and would rather read than play with other toys.\n\nPROS:\n- It offers an alternative to mom/dad always reading a story the same way.\n- Helps the child create memories and use imagination when hearing sounds.\n- Pages seem to hold up pretty well to the rigours of a small child.\n- Sounds/words are very clear and audible\n\nCONS:\n- On/off button and volume button is on the front of the toy.  It screams \"touch me\"  I usually can't get thru 2 pages of a story w/out dd turning the toy off 5 times.\n- In order to make the sounds/ words go, you must push pretty hard.  My daughter was gentle with her touch and it was nearly impossible for her to have enough force to push the \"sounds\".\n- Dd gets bored quickly because mom & dad have to do all the pushing (see comment above).\n- Books/ cartridges seem to get separated unless you keep them in a large container or in their original boxes (of which the company doesn't not include one with the toy - - so where do you put the original cartridge/book that comes with the toy?).\n- Not many \"add-on\" books/ cartridges\n\nWe've resorted to just letting her turn the pages by herself and push the on/off button as many times as she wants. We don't even try to read the stories to her.\nDon't waste your money on this one. Stick to old-fashioned books (book boards) and work on your singing/ sounds voice.\n\nDD IS NOW 2 YEARS OLD AND SHE HAS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS STARTED TO USE THIS TOY AS IT WAS INTENDED.  SHE STILL PUSHES THE ON/OFF BUTTON AND VOLUMEN BUTTONS A LOT, HOWEVER SHE NOW UNDERSTANDS ABOUT PUSHING THE GREEN \"GO\" BUTTON BEFORE THE PICTURES WILL MAKE THE CORRECT SOUNDS AND HAS ENOUGH FORCE TO DO SO.  ALSO, IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT THEY'VE COME OUT WITH MORE THAN 4 CARTRIDGES/BOOKS.\n\nALTHOUGH IS BEEN A YEAR LATER, MY OPINION IS STILL THE SAME.  THE BOX SAYS 0-36 MONTHS.  BY THE TIME THAT A CHILD IS OLD ENOUGH TO USE THE PRODUCT CORRECTLY, THEY'VE ALMOST GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT THEY COULD JUST USE THE NEXT LEVEL UP OF LEAPFROG.  I WOULD STILL SAY SKIP THIS ONE.",

Its so much fun and the possibilities are endless. u can have an affair with the hot maid, get married 2 an ailen, focus on ur work soley, earn alot of money snog alot of ppl, have millions of granchildren and so on and so on. It took me ages making ma sim family and i done thm all down 2 evry last detail (evn to the chubbieness of thier cheeks). thn i played it for sum time (about 3 weeks i think) and realised tht the graphics were real gd!! Not good Great. well they had 2 b didn't they? if it costed me 130 for an upgrade for ma pc just 2 play a 30 game. thn after a while i found sum really annoying bugs. and sum things tht rn't very realistic in the game. 1st i'll point out sum unrealistic things about the game. y do they put the radio on for no reason evn whn they know sum1 is sleeping?? n' y do they age soo fast?? and y do nevr know wot beds theirs?? i mean every1 knows whos beds whos! y cant they??\nNow on 2 the bugs. i'll just list a few out of a possible 14 in the game. i mean all this time looking and searching for bugs Maxis didn't do a very gd job of FIXING thm all. the bug tht annoys me the most is whn a visitor comes ova and is holding ur baby/toddler whn he/she leaves while holding a toddler/baby they don't put thm back down or in their crib, no no, they walk of screen with ur baby and u'll neva c it again-its gone for ever. Another bad bug is whn the maids van disappears but u still hear the engine for ages. same with the r.c. car. and sumtimes whn teens sneak out they never come bak. also it pisses me off whn a npc gets stuck in ur bit and it really slow the game down. It also bugs me whn sum1 dies or moves out they are still in the family photo whn about 2 go in2 a house! y? and its happened 2 me a couple of times tht once 2 adult try 2 get the same toddler at the same time the 1st 1 their grabs it and streaches their arms all the way behind thm for sum reason. and i absoulty H8 the nanny. she puts ma toddler in the chair thn out the chair thn bak in the chair and out the chair thn in the chair an.......till ma bay gets really mad and i get it taken off me!!\nOverall a reall gd 1 of a kind game but if it didn't cost 2 much for all those upgrades ( u must admit the minimuim requirements are for 2 big for ur aging computers), if it a little more realistic and it didn't have SOOOOOOO MANY BUGS!!!!!!! it would definetly deserve a five stars and a game of the year award! but it hasnt..... were now waiting for maxis 2 make sum patches for sum of the bugs real slowly!! diapointing maxis, disapointing! :(",

            "Rise and fall of Chris Christie  from Superstorm Sandy to Bridgegate\nDonald Trump and  Chris Christie  campaign in 2016. (Photo: John Minchillo  AP)\nI recall  Chris Christie’s  first interview with our editorial board after he won the 2009 election. We asked what had changed in his life now that he was governor of New Jersey.\nMore:  Chris Christie  polishes  his  Trump brand as the swamp beckons\nMore:  Chris Christie  on the beach: New Jersey had a bad day  why should he suffer?\nThe governor’s fight against opioid abuse won him national praise. But the standing ovation really should go to the Christie who pushed for drug courts  treatment over incarceration and the near elimination of cash bail. No other governor could have done so much to right the scales of justice for minorities and low-income defendants. None of this is sexy to voters in national primaries  which makes these initiatives so much more important in judging all that was  Christie . He was capable of being a great leader.\nThen came Superstorm Sandy— the event that made  Christie  a national figure even as it pretty much set in motion everything that destroyed him. It fed his ego. The national attention he received in his blue fleece telling someone to get off the beach  the bombast that was akin to a happy King Lear  not howling at the wind  but pushing the wind back. He seemed invincible.\nAfter Sandy  Christie was a rising Republican star. Everything he did was now seen through a rosy prism. He was the Republican governor of a blue state getting things done. To be clear: New Jersey is neither blue nor red. It’s madras. Tom Kean  Christie Whitman — Republicans had won statewide before. New Jersey wanted a reformer in 2009 and  Christie  seemed to fit that bill.\nThe most telling moment from  Christie’s  final State of the State address this month was a sentence he ad-libbed. The prepared text read: “We ran to be a Governor who did not just mark time. We ran to win and to be a Governor of consequence.” What  Christie  said during the speech was  “I ran to win. I always ran to win. I ran to be a governor of consequence.”\nThat’s it in a nutshell. The fatal flaw. A chief executive consumed with winning who would assemble a team consumed with his winning. It explains more than anything how Bridgegate could come to pass  how a smart  politically savvy man like  Christie  could put so many of the wrong people in high-profile jobs. Did he know before the George Washington Bridge lane closures  during the lane closures or shortly after the lane closures that created a massive four-day traffic jam? At this point it matters less than that he always knew too many people on his team were capable of being punitive  petty and destructive in the cause of  Christie  winning.\n Christie  tried to minimize the scandal.  He  wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on a whitewash report prepared by high-priced lawyers.  He  bled NJ Transit dry.\n He  bullied.  He  baited. And just as Sandy had made  him  a star  Bridgegate made  him  a pariah. Not all at once. But by the time  he  left New Jersey to raise money for Republican governors across the nation and then to openly pursue the presidency   he  was already failing in New Jersey.\nI once was as close to a Christie cheerleader as  he  could find in the New Jersey media. There was a time when I believed  he  was the real deal.  He  was funny  well informed and enjoyed a vigorous debate on issues — at least off the record.\nThe brilliance of  Christie  remains somewhere inside him  but he was not the greatest natural politician I will ever see. The greatest natural politician would never forget that he was entirely dependent on the charity of others — voters.  Christie  once told a young man at a town hall who asked how to get into politics that you first have to ask people for their votes. He said a candidate had to recognize that voters could choose anyone they wanted  that receiving a vote was a gift.\nThe governor forgot that lesson or  as his ratings tanked  decided it no longer mattered. He became more important than anything. It was not about New Jersey winning  but  Christie  winning.\nVoters elected  Christie  to serve until Jan. 16  2018  but he checked out on Election Day 2013.",

It  works very well within twenty feet of your subject, provided that you have a clear view of that person. In other words it doesn't work well around corners, or even with other people standing between you and your subject.\n\n2. It does not function well at all in a busy convention center atmosphere. I just returned from a convention in Orlando where there were as many as fifty other wireless systems being used, and the Pro 88W system was almost completely useless. I had to resort to running a 12' cable to my spokemodel's microphone. Having more than just two channels may have helped this situation.\n\nCertainly the Pro 88 is a good value. It's constructed very well. I'm happy that it uses 3.5mm connections, (the same as my Canon DSLR) and requires a 9 volt battery, which are my favorite power source. However in my case I am going to have to upgrade to a more expensive UHF system.\n\nSincerely -\n\nRobert Marcos",

            "This is Perry's third novel and it's a bit of a disappointment after his first two. Altmeyer is a Los Angeles \"businessman\" -- if supplying mostly illegal weapons to almost any government, corporation, or individual with the money is a business -- and his lovely wife, Rachel, helps out wherever she can. Their friend, Bucky, is a big-deal Hollywood agent whom they help to escape from a dangerous drug deal by killing off the other side. The early parts of the narrative are rather disjointed and episodic; they don't seem to have much to do with each other, rather than to introduce the characters. Then a shipment of 9-millimeter automatics to Japan goes wrong and it doesn't look like Altmeyer is going to get paid, but that's not the half of it. The Really Bad Guys were interested not in Altmeyer's guns but in his international shipping methods, which they adopt for their own use. And what they're shipping from one country to another appear to be terrorist-sized nuclear devices. Here the story gets more interesting, the three main characters being joined by a legendary film producer with all the right contacts. The plot is still a bit fuzzy, though, and Perry should have spent more time tidying it up. Not up to his previous work.",

I like to do a full draft and the game doesn't appear to have to do it, but it does have a trade feature. If 3DO can keep the playability of this game and improve the graphics and options then they could have a real winner.

            "\"Freedom Force Vs. The 3rd Reich\" is the sequel to the original \"Freedom Force\" released in 2002.  In fact, this game is almost identical to the original -- the story is different, and the graphics are a little better, but other than that, it's the same.  But that's not a bad thing -- the original was a great game, and so is this.  The characters, the voice acting, the story line -- several times while playing I've said \"Just one more level\" because I had to know what was coming next.  And after that level would end, I'd say \"Just one more level\" again!  The game really captures the fun of 1960's comic books (I used to collect comics in the 80's, but stopped when I realized that I had begun collecting for profit instead of fun).  The game also has low system requirements, which is nice.\n\nI do however have two gripes with this game.  The first is that the game is advertised as having \"Story-Based Multiplayer.\"  To me, this implies that you can play a series of missions in multiplayer, possibly cooperatively.  In actuality, for this game, it means neither.  The \"Story-Based Multiplayer\" in this game is a NORMAL multiplayer game, with a \"story\" description which you can give it, and an optional picture that you can assign to it.  That's it!  There's no \"story\" per se, no sequence of missions, and no cooperative play.\n\nThe other gripe I have is with the game's \"amazing hero editor\".  This is how it's described on the box, featuring a graphic of a group of heroes from the game standing together.  But surprise, that picture isn't the hero editor, it's just an in-game shot.  The actual hero editor is identical to what was included in the first game: you can pick a good amount of skills and powers for your character, but they only provide 4 sample \"skins\", which determine what your hero looks like.  So if you want to create more than 4 new characters, some will look alike -- unless you also download the 20MB mod kit, which includes a character editor...sort of.  The \"Character Tool 2\" program allows you to copy skins and \"meshes\" (the wireframe model which determines the size and shape of a character) and edit skins using an existing graphics program on your PC.  Editing skins can be a painstaking process using a paint program because the skin appears as a flattened, disjointed version of the character.  There may be an easier method of editing skins, but unfortunately, if there is, I'm not aware of it.  I've edited several skins for the original game, and each one usually took about an hour.  I would love to get some sort of 3D modelling program, maybe that would allow editing of the skin on a wireframe, but why should you have to purchase something additional to do what the game implies that IT will allow you to do?  This is in stark contrast to a game like \"The Sims 2\", which includes a character editor which allows you to customize your characters in almost any way imaginable -- you can easily create characters in \"The Sims 2\" which look like people you know.  I realize that this game's developer, \"Irrational Games\", probably doesn't have the resources to put towards an effort like that, but how about SOME sort of skin editor -- perhaps a utility that would allow you to choose from various pre-defined faces and costume types, allow you to set the colors, and then generate a skin file on the fly?\n\nThose misgivings aside, this is a great game.  But they do mislead you with the claims made on the packaging.",

            "I typically don't write a review when there dozens if not hundreds of reviews as is the case here. What prompts me to do so in this case is that there hasn't been much of balanced review of the marble mouse in a while - I think its all tied to the mouse versus trackball debate. Everybody seems to want to chime in with \"Yeah, for the beleaguered trackball!\". You would have to sift through several pages of the submitted reviews to form an adequate summary of this products strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIf you, like me, have scoured the internet for a left handed mouse, this product pops up most of the time along with a couple that are far more expensive. So this product's most appealing characteristics are that it can be used with either hand with equal ease as well as its low price.\n\nThe marble mouse's detriments include the oft mentioned lack of a real scroll button. Some reviewers have also noted that this model is not as ergonomically well designed as other trackballs in that it does not provide adequate hand support.  I also think that the buttons are poorly designed in that the two smaller buttons are far too small and therefore not very accessible. A person with large hands probably would find using the two secondary buttons difficult. Finally this trackball is still tethered to a cord while most other mice and trackballs now offered are wireless. It is my thinking that Logitech knows that lefthanded users don't have many affordable options beyond this product so there is little incentive to improve it.\n\nIn summary, I find that the marble mouse works well enough particularly for its price and right/left hand flexibility. But compared with other trackballs, it lacks the functionality and ergonomics to make it a highly valued component of a computing system. It is a pity and perhaps an indication of Logitech's market dominance that this product has been around for several years and nobody has yet made a better trackball for use by both hands.",

This brand also has less elastic type material than the Silhouettes which makes it harder for her to keep them up after only one or two pull downs/ups. On a positive note, the padding in the crotch area, although a bit too short to offer excellent protection, is much thicker so protection is relatively good in the middle crotch area.  Plus the glue that affixes the pad to the pantie hasn't caused an irritation to her lower belly area like the glue now used in the Silhouettes.  Guess this brand would do in a pinch but....",

The monster and armor art is better but on the scenery side there is more of the big featureless areas that make the game much less immersive and less interesting. AI has changed for the worse, but that was happening in the earlier chapters before nightfall was released. The extreme it has reached is much like other video games, highly overpowered nearly invincible enemies that have no tactics and do little more than target the healer using abilities that can kill the whole group in one hit (ones the player can never have).\n\nAlthough this is an online game expect teaming with real people to be very rare. Most of the remaining loyal players are very antisocial and obsessive, so almost no one plays with other people. Consider it a online single player game as you'll be playing with AI controlled party memebers.\n\nThe price is much too high. Even though you pay no monthly fee after the initial purchase, the content and game design really isn't worth more than the most bargain basement price tag(maybe $10). The earlier chapters should also be included since no one is playing them anymore anyway. It could be some interesting scenery and a slight variation in quest themes. That could give the average non-obsessive player at least a few weeks of playtime before they get bored and erase it.",

Whenever, I used to venture out to arcades and golflands, I would seek out a Gottlieb pinball machine for a fun time with the metal ball and flippers.\n\nSo when I heard that a Gottlieb Collection was going to be released, I was pretty jazzed about it. Unfortunatly, the actual product fell a little too short of my expectations.\n\nBut first, the good things. I liked the fact that included are tables from every decade starting from the 50's. There are nice little extras such as pinball art, fun facts, and an unlockable table. The audio of each table was nice.\n\nNow, I really didn't enjoy the physics of each table. The movement of the ball felt a little too loose and a bit light. I'm not a big fan of using polygon graphics to mimick the look of a pinball table. Gives it kind of a bland, undetailed look. I much prefer the ditigized look of a pinball table.\n\nAlso, Tee'd Off came out in 1993 and included an LCD display as all tables from the 90's did. Crave, however, did not do a very good job of placing the display on screen. It is somewhere on a bottom corner instead of on top as it is with all pinballs.\n\nUnfortanely for pinball fans, there is a dearth of pinball simulations/collection on the PS 2. So although this collection is a little dissapointing, it is one of only a handful of options for me to get my pinball fix on the PS 2.",

As far is it's performance goes, it does everything the package states however it leaves a bit to be desired with how it looks on paper.  Just looks like your average Bic ballpoint writing on the paper.\n\nMy real gripe with this pen is the clip design, and I think people should be aware of this before you make a $17 purchase here.  When you do buy the versions with the clips, fisher neglected to make some sort of a recessed area in the cap so the clip could snap into place preventing it from slipping back off.  So what inevitably winds up happening is, the clip keeps slipping/falling off when you go to use it (even more so with the chrome model due to the slick finish).\n\nKind of off putting especially considering your spending $17 on the pen... Now I understand that it's got all these special features like writing upside down, underwater, etc. But it still shouldn't be at the cost of a functional and reliable pocket clip should it?\n\nI'm not trying to be overly critical here or anything, I'm just stating the obvious pitfalls.\nFeel free to comment on this review if you would like.",

I wasn't expecting reference audiophile quality for $125/pair, but these were disappointing even compared with the gimmicky powered \"multimedia\" speakers plugged into my computer's headphone jack... and paled in comparison to my middle-of-the-road bookshelf speakers.\n\nAs you'd expect, these do not deliver deep, punchy bass (but that's why Polk reasonably recommends pairing them with a subwoofer), but low tones are clear and passable. Midrange, however, is basically nonexistent. Forget rich, full, warm sound. These are sound like what you get when you push the middle changes of your graphic EQ all the way down. And that tiny tweeter delivers a narrow, tinny sound that even sucks the life out of over-DSPed electronica recordings. Oh well.\n\nThe good news is that they're physically shallow (though relatively large-diameter), so they can fit in some ceilings that non-concentric models don't.

            "Bernard Cornwell, who created the very successful Sharpe series of novels about the Napoleonic Wars turns his attention to prehistory with \"Stonehenge, 2000 B.C.\". He has fitted a detailed picture of neolithic life into a plot full of love, mayhem, and intrigue. For good measure he tosses in an explanation of the mysteries surrounding the greatest construction project in prehistoric Britain.\nIt is the story of three half-brothers, sons of the chief of Ratharryn, who hate one another murderously, but whom fate entwines in an endeavor that lasts for the remainder of their lives. Lengar, the oldest, becomes chief by killing their father. He then sells Saban into slavery in Wales and takes his wife as a concubine. Crippled Carraban seeks sanctuary with Ratharryn's neighbor and rival Cathallo, where he becomes a sorcerer. They are reunited when Carraban convinces Lengar he must build a stone temple to the sun god and that Saban is the man to build it.\nCornwell does an excellent job of describing the techniques archeologists believe were used to construct two successive stone temples at the site of Stonehenge, but he compresses the work into a single generation. I think this was a mistake -- apart from its dubious factual foundation -- because it diminishes our awe at the ingenuity of conception and difficulty of execution. Part of the grandeur of Chartres Cathedral is that its construction was measured in generations not in years. Having Saban accomplish a miracle of neolithic engineering -- not once but twice -- truncates the magnificence of the achievement. Cornell glosses over the impossible economic demands that such rapid construction would make on a subsistence neolithic society.\nSpreading the events over multiple novels would have been consistent with Cornwell's previous work, but would have required whole generations of new characters. That might not have been a bad thing. Saban is not as interesting as his vicious half-brothers -- or his two wives for that matter! (In the movie version, I see Kevin Costner as Saban, John Malkovitch as Lengar, and Gary Oldman as Carraban) Cornwell, who is so facile at plotting, perhaps is stingy at creating central characters. After all he used Richard Sharpe and Arthur Wellesley through sixteen novels.",

I follow all the instructions but these units last about 1 year and then just stop working. You can get a new head (the part that breaks) for about $125 from the manufacturer. I kept buying them because they vertually eliminated the mosquito population in my FL backyard. I gave it 3 stars for effectiveness. I cost and length of time in service were not considered, it would get 5 stars because it does the job. Too bad they cannot build them better. Oh, and when I call them about the problems I've had, the rep is about as sypathetic to my problem as talking to a rock.\n\nAdded comment 4/9/2008: This company has recently been bought and the support is now great. Also, I have found that they honor their warranty. I have also found that I was able to get an extended warranty quite cheaply at Home Depot and although the product does still break, it can be fixed and returned quite quickly. (I went back to using this product as the others I tried just didn't work.)\n\nSupport told me that a big reason for the units going bad is that the propane tank is left in the unit empty and the piezo igniter keeps trying to light the non-existant propane every 5 minutes and wears out. So the solution is to make sure that you swap out the tank every 21 days even if the unit is still working. Also, do not get the refills from HD or Lowes, get the tanks refilled yourself so that you can be sure the tank is (a) full, and (b) any air is bled out.",

Although to have a balanced perspective the monsters are reparative beyond belief.\n\nSo you could rightly ask why am giving the game three stars?  Three words Blizzard Customer Service.  It is godawful.  I realize that this is a game that many people play and that the servers have to be updated from time to time.  I have been playing the game for a week now (7 days) and the servers have been down 8 hours a day for 3 of those days.  When the servers do come back online nothing works correctly and so they are forced to take them down again a few days later and the cycle repeats itself.\n\nOverall-Fantastic game but I don't recommend that you buy it if you want good customer service and servers that actually work.\nRemember how long we had to wait for the Orc campaign on Frozen Throne?

The blade gets bent during the coarse of normal use and then develops a fracture at the bend, usually right near the tip, then it tears off.  22 feet of wasted tape!  Sometimes this happens within days of purchase and sometimes it is months, but it ALWAYS happens.  Stanley used to have a lifetime warranty and you could buy replacement tapes, not any more on either of those.  For such a premium over other tapes that really stinks.  This is by far the most common tape on all of the job sites with any trade contractor too.  It does perform better than anything out there regarding reach out and smoothness but I can't get over the lack of durability.  Remember those old silver box stanley's? I know some guys who have been using those for 15 years and still use them.  This would definitely be a 5 star product if they could make them more durable.  It is upsetting because when you read the package they claim to have all this new technology to make it the most rugged tape ever.  I can't baby these things at work, they need to be tough.  All that said, it is still the only tape I like to use.  They look like you could run over them with a truck, huh? An empty wheel barrow ran over the tape laying flat and created a bend that tore 2 days later!  Maybe homeowners would never have a problem.  They should sell them with a velvet case.",

There are times when I caught myself just gunning past all the mundane dialogue just to get to the surgeries.  I am NOT a big fan of text heavy games, unless the conversations are interesting or at least animated!  I realize that polite society causes us all to do the \"Hello, how's the weather?\" thing, but do surgeons really spend so much time playing nurse?!  And since this is clearly fantasy, that's all the more annoying!  I'm thinking that all in-game dialogue EVER should be able to be sped up or skipped altogether.  Sometimes, people just want to get to the action!\n\nMy last complaint is the sometimes asinine sensitivity of a task.  When you're working on a screen this small, there has to be some allowance for minute error.  I mean, even my usually careful handwriting looks like crap on a slick surface...  but the technology will only improve with time.  Okay, my randomly affectionate cat doesn't help matters...\n\nOverall, the series has some potential but I'd much rather have a more realistic game that actually teaches usable medical terminology and lets you combine brain power with surgical technique.  I imagine I would REALLY suck at the Wii version-- I can't imagine trying to follow lines I'm not touching with a stylus.\n\nOverall, this game was a disappointment.

            "I think this movie is better as a \"period piece\" than as a movie.  It's not an indie film, even though it's trying hard to look like one.\n\nThe problem is that the characters are all such jerks that you don't care.  Steve Zahn might be OK but he's wasted on a completely underdeveloped character.  Janeane Garofalo is messed up and annoying but at least has a little potential that makes her likeable.  Ben Stiller is out of step with the other characters but I think he's young and inexperienced more than he is evil.\n\nEthan Hawke and Winona Ryder, though, whom we're supposed to adore, are a pair of self-centered, egotistical, [deleted expletives] who deserve each other and whatever emotionally-combative life they build together.  Interestingly, they're also the two who are least in touch with reality--Hawke is still trying to be the genius/James Dean-come-lately skating by because he's too good to do any real work, and Ryder basically expects to be handed her dream life while being permitted to think that she earned it.  The lines that are supposed to make Hawke look like he's challenging Ryder for her own good just sound, well, abusive.  The white dress scene, in particular--how is listening to Hawke tell her to change different from listening to Stiller tell her he likes the dress and she looks fine as she is?  Nothing she says is the right answer; if she keeps the dress, even if it's because she really does like it, Hawke browbeats her and accuses her of pandering to Stiller.  If she changes, Hawke will credit her for thinking independently . . . because it soothes his raging ego, even though it still wouldn't be her decision.\n\nAnyway . . . if you didn't see this when you were in your twenties in the 1990's, it's probably too late, unless you want a peek at how Hollywood was trying to sell itself to Gen-X'ers.",

            "Noisy? Only on rewind or fast forward.\nEats tapes? Hardly.\nBad recording? Not from what I can see.\nThis was a better machine than the JVC I've reported on. I couldn't get this machine to automatically program the clock for me, but it did fine with the cable channels and programming the clock is pretty easy.\nOverall, this is a very easy machine to use. It's my third Panasonic VCR I've owned. In fact, it's the third VCR I've ever owned, my first two being Panasonics as well. My first lasted 20 years, the second 10 years. Hopefully, this one will last as long if not longer than the previous ones.\nUnlike the JVC and many other VCRs I looked at, this one does NOT require you to hit a TIMER button in order for it to go into standby recording mode. Just program what you want to record (whether it's one time, daily or weekly), hit the power button and your done. You have up to 8 slots to program, which is nice and seems to be the standard these days. My previous Panasonic only had 2 slots, so this is a VAST improvement for me.\nThe remote can program various name brand TVs unlike the JVC remote, which ONLY worked with JVC TVs. Also, I was able to get this machine into my universal remote whereas with the JVC, I couldn't.\nPicture playback is pretty clear and the colors look fine, whether on a pre-recorded movie or from a recording I did from the TV.\nNo tapes have been eaten and playback from the machine is NOT noisy at all. I guess those other people have VERY sensitive hearing or else, they bought a bad machine.\nFeaturewise, it's pretty standard. My only gripe with this machine (and the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of possibly 4) is that I have experienced a problem that others have stated in that it rejects tapes sometimes. You'll put in a tape sometimes and then it spits it out. After another try or two, it generally takes it. The only thing I can fathom is that the spindles on the machine are not sensing the spindles on the tape correctly, so it assumes it's not seating correctly and spits it out. Either shaking the tape or just trying it another time or two has worked for me and I have experienced this with my other two machines once in awhile, but not to the degree that I experience with this machine. But, that is a MINOR factor for my wife, who  is the main user of this machine.\nOverall, this is a pretty good machine and I've had pretty good experiences with Panasonic in the past, which is why I finally came back to this one.",

            "I purchased this garage for my 2+ year old son based on the high reviews. Fairly easy assembly.  My biggest complaint is that the gas pump is located underneath the entire structure (that's why you can hardly see it in the photos). Thus, it is very difficult to access (even with encouragement, my son gave up and just ignored it altogether), which is very unfortunate because the gas pump is one of the \"funnest\" features. I fixed the situation by unscrewing the gas pump platform (2 pumps on the platform) and gluing it to the side of the base-floor of the entire garage ... problem solved, but now it's a bit of an odd lay-out of course. My second issue is with the elevator. It's a fun \"crank\" elevator (and makes a great noise when turned), but because the platform is flat, the cars roll out of it with just one crank. To keep the car on the platform while the elevator is going up or down, I put a thin strip of glue along the back of the elevator floor, so the car stays put and it's still easy to \"drive out\" of the elevator.  I also glued down the 2 ramps (as other reviewers had suggested). As far as other cars fitting (aka, Matchbox cars), some do, but only if they are very small. The wooden \"Plan\" toy cars work much better with this garage.  All in all, it's a decent garage, but for the price, I would not have expected the above issues.",

            "I'm surprised this book has received such great reviews as I did not find it as compelling as his previous works, all of which I have read.  Like most of Rollins' books, the Sigma Force characters are front and center as a recurring secret government task force sent to do things that don't technically need to be done and as people that don't really exist.  It works well for all of the Rollins' novels to date, but in my opinion misses the mark in this one.\n\nThe book starts with a very high value target being kidnapped in The Seychelles and Sigma Force being brought in the recover her.  It turns out that The Guild, which is a worldwide terror network, might be behind the kidnapping.  For numerous novels now, Sigma Force has been trying to figure out who The Guild are and what they do and what exactly they are responsible for.  To say they are \"Shadowy\" Would be an understatement.  Now, the answer to that question of who The Guild is, will mostly sort of arrive in this book.  The answer is interesting and worth finding out if it's been a burning question in your life.  The problem in my mind is that one of Rollins' strong points in the past has been blending action with history and science.  Similar to Dan Brown's best work, you get to learn something while you read a great piece of fiction.  I thought this book was significantly heavier on the action a la Matthew Reilly than intelligence.  There are numerous subplots which if you have read the other books will make sense but if you haven't-might be a little distracting to boot.  A nice piece on what is fact vs. fiction at the end of this book and a good solid read, but if you haven't read Rollins before or only read several of his works-don't start here.  Go with Devil Colony, Black Order or Map of Bones.  You will find adventure and education a plenty in those master works.",

            "When my sister visited me last month; she spent most of the weekend on the couch with this book.  She read off some of the passages, and we laughed; they were so true of our own family.  She warned me to put the book away when the family came, which illustrates the extent that the mundane aspects of everyday living can be the most taboo for a family.\nThe book is all about family expectations and their dysfunctional effects.  The book deals with a family grappling with the reality of their disappointments. The dialogue is biting, funny and some of Frazen's imagination is absolutely off the wall.\nBut in general, I was disappointed.  I really expected this to be great literature. I found the writing to be inefficient, wastefully silly in some places (although some of the silly passages were absolutely hysterical, like the elevator dialogue), and can see why there's an abridged version. This is in contrast to Frazen's wonderful New Yorker writing which made me want to read this book in the first place.\nStill, the book resonates; especially well done is the theme of ageing and impairment, as the father's Parkinsons' not only takes his toll on him and as it radiates through the entire family.",

            "\"Trivial Pursuit: 1990s Edition\" continues the recent trend of the Trivial Pursuit creators to develop games that appeal to specific, niche audiences.  This game promises to ask questions from \"the most trivial of decades\", and it delivers.  Similar to other versions, the 1990s Edition requires players to move around a board and collect pie pieces from different categories (sports, entertainment, technology, news, etc).  Success in the game requires players to answer questions like: Who once said, \"a zebra can't change its spots\"?  And whose ear did Mike Tyson try to eat?\n\nThe packaging of this game seems rushed.  Only four game pieces are included and two (Computer Screen and Palm Pilot) look alike.  The game also contains a very limited amount of questions, meaning die-hard players will run out fairly quickly.  With more imagination and a deeper desire to put-forth and enjoyable product, this game could have been much better.",

My son still plays with that set at my grandmother's house. That one comes with a full-sized sheet of each completed puzzle for younger children. You pick which one you want, place the picture in the tray, and then assemble the puzzle on top of that.\nThe least Melissa and Doug could do would be to link to a website or something where you can print these off.

            "I am the first to admit I watch a lot of movies. In fact, I watch far more movies than the average person ever should. That I don't burn through DVD players every few months or wear eyeglasses the size of a mountaintop telescope is amazing considering I mix my movie experiences with healthy doses of reading and studying for my master's degree in history. I came to the conclusion long ago that I need my hour and a half a day movie to relieve stress. And since I avoid broadcast television like the plague, spending a couple of hours with a movie ensures I stay plugged into the all important pop culture conduits that crisscross every level of our society. Despite what most people say, movies and movie watching will tell you more about the world you live in than any other source of information. One need go no further than the movies, although I would recommend books as well, to understand the history of modern America. Take the 1990s, for example. No other film sums up the decade of political correctness, the Clintons, and the culture wars better than \"American Beauty.\" How you look at this film depends entirely on your opinion of that decade.\n\n\"American Beauty\" tells the story of the Burnham family, specifically patriarch Lester (Kevin Spacey), matriarch Carolyn (Annette Bening), and daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Set in a place the lunkheads in Hollywood hate with the heat of a million suns, suburbia, the movie begins with Lester speaking in voiceover. He tells us that he died, and he tells us that he will show us why he died. O.k., that's an interesting way to hook the viewer. And since Spacey's a pretty talented actor, I'll keep watching. The Burnham household is not a haven for happy campers. Lester slaves away all day at some phone/marketing job that he obviously hates. Wife Carolyn spends her time competing with Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) in the dog eat dog world of real estate. Jane Burnham is a teenager obviously unhappy with her physical appearance since we see her checking out plastic surgery sites on the Internet. Although the Burnham family does not yet know it, their lives are about to transform in significant ways. It all starts when Lester loses his position at the firm due to a restructuring. Fortunately for him, he knows some sordid information about his employer that allows him to walk out with a hefty severance package.\n\nLester's change--let's call it a regression to the halcyon days of his youth--isn't due solely to his dismissal at work. Jane's attractive friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) captured Lester's eye, and when he overhears her make a comment about how good looking he is, Burnham decides to embark on a radical regimen of weightlifting to improve his physique. Lester also takes a stand against his overbearing wife for the first time in years, which eventually drives Carolyn into the arms of an unlikely lover. In the meantime, Lester also buys a hotrod, finds a job at a fast food restaurant, and begins to dally in drugs with the help of neighborhood dealer and new next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Jane falls into the orbit of the enigmatic Ricky as well, and the two strike up a rather unusual relationship in which both can find solace from their emotional pain. Ricky's life is far from perfect; he must constantly deal with his physically and psychologically abusive former military officer father, referred to as the Colonel (Chris Cooper). The entire film centers on how these various people interact with one another.\n\nWhen \"American Beauty\" came out in 1999, we all heard the endless panegyrics praising every aspect of the picture. Those \"in the know\" proclaimed it a modern masterpiece, a sublime objet d'art that cut to the core of the modern American existence. Uh...no. I'll accept the argument that Kevin Spacey turned in a stellar performance as a man so tired of his dreary existence that he seeks refuge in the comfortable memories of his teenage years. I'll also accept the claim that Wes Bentley does a fine job in the difficult role of Ricky Fitts. I think all of the performers did a good job with their respective parts. But \"American Beauty\" as a modern masterpiece? An insightful look into the vacuous core of modern America? Sure, if you're a left-winger who thinks America is a horrible place to live. According to this film, if you're a member of a traditional American family living in the suburbs you will never be truly happy. You will never find fulfillment in anything you do because your existence is pretentious and emotionally stilted. Moreover, it's been a long time since I've seen a film that harbors this much hatred for the armed services. According to \"American Beauty,\" military men are pure evil because they collect guns, National Socialist regalia, physically abuse their family members, and are deeply hypocritical about very personal issues. The film makes sure that it draws a distinct connection between military service and these traits; it hits you over the head with it repeatedly. I could go on and on.\n\nExtras on this \"Award Edition\" DVD include behind the scenes stuff, a commentary track with the director and writer, storyboard presentations, two trailers, cast and crew biographies and filmographies, and production notes. I think I can still give the film three stars solely for the great performances, the even better score, and good atmosphere (love that opening shot swooping down the street). But I find the beating of chests and gnashing of teeth plotline about the destructive effects of suburbia banal and extraordinarily false.",
