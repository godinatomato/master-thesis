Strava bills itself as a \u00e2\u0080\u009csocial-networking app for athletes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The \u00e2\u0080\u009cheat map\u00e2\u0080\u009d showed the location of all the rides  runs  swims  and downhills that its users have taken  as collected by their smartphones and wearables.\nBecause as bad as the publicly available heat map is  the underlying data that Strava is collecting is a security nightmare for governments around the world. The data being collected could allow anyone with access to it the ability to make a pattern of life map for individual users  some of whom may be very interesting.\nTaiwan did not move the base  though. And  as you can see  there are a number of avid Strava users who work there  causally jogging right by the parking lot where the missile launchers are parked.\nNow here is the problem. This is only one of several missile bases in Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0094an important one  to be sure  but there are others  and some of those locations may still be secret. (At the Middlebury Institute of International studies at Monterey  we try to track these bases pretty closely. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident we know where several are located  for example  but not all of them.) But  Strava\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  database has one more piece of information  one that is not accessible through the heat map but would be to the company  any client which might purchase the data and any hacker that might steal  it .  Strava  knows which user made each track. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charming when  it \u00e2\u0080\u0099s a celebrity uploading a run. But what about a soldier? Soldiers  remember  rotate from one assignment to the next. Which means  Strava  can continue to track each user as  he  or  she  rotates to the next assignment  burning one secret missile base after another with all those calories. Yes  if our user casually jogging by Taiwanese missiles day-after-day suddenly appears deployed to a new location  well that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very interesting if you are targeting missiles for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rocket Force.\nA fair amount of personal data appears to be shared willingly by users  more than enough to make me uncomfortable. A bigger concern  of course  is whether hackers might be able to breach security and get at the data marked private. If I were a  Strava  employee  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be very careful about what sort of email links I clicked on.\nNone of this is to blame  Strava   of course.  It  provides a service that lots of people obviously find useful. I myself could use to lose a few pounds. And  of course  it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts at secrecy were super impressive to begin with. No one is really at fault here  other than individual users who may have violated security procedures. What the heat map does illustrate  though  is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re living in a very different age than the one where we developed a lot of our ideas about deterrence and strategic stability.", "Very cute, all right, but came with a gouge (not so cute) in the roof!", "... it does what you should expect it to. No, it doesn't magically erase all scratches and make it as if you have a new paint job fresh from the body shop. What it does do is help minimize the appearance of fine surface scratches from wiping the paint with cloths that weren't lint or dust free. This is primarily evident on dark solid colors. My black Impala was riddled with fine swirl marks all over it from whatever the previous owner washed and dried it with (looked like 600 sandpaper) but since putting 3 coats of this TW black on the car and lightly buffing it off with a 100% cotton towel it has regained a nice slippery smooth feel and look. Now when lights hit it in the driveway at night it doesn't look like it's covered in spider webs anymore.\nThe drawback to using it is you definitely need gloves because this stuff will dye everything and anything it gets on BLACK, including your hands and everything you get near.\nI have learned that it needs to be put on relatively heavy and let it dry for a while. Stay out of sunlight and don't do it after driving, you will end up with a caked on coating on the hood you'll never get off. Do it in the garage in the morning when it's cool. Use a heavy cotton bath towel folded over into a square to lightly buff it off. Don't rub and press like you're trying to scrape off the paint, you want to make sure you leave behind the protective layer and only remove the hazy film.\nMy car is a 2002 and the paint is not in the best of shape as it looks like it's taken many a beating from hail stones and pine pitch, but after each application of this product it is beginning to regain it's deep glassy appearance. I will definitely buy another bottle when this one is gone. It is unquestionably a step in the right direction over plain jane milky colored wax, that's for sure. It's kinda like the no brainer of what would you be better off polishing black shoes with: white or black shoe polish?

If it weren't for the sloppy editing, this would be a really good read.", "@SenSchumer @keithellison @elizabethforma @SenSanders Anything? https://t.co/F9C6MzsK0t", "(Note this may contain spoilers)\n\nI never played the first NWN game but my husband said it was good and I decided to give this one a shot.  The character selection screen isn't all that great. Don't get me wrong there is a wide selection of character races and classes to choose from but choosing what your character should look like is rather poor. Hardly much to choose from and not enough to make your character the way you want them to look.\n\nFrom there it goes into the game. As you travel through the realm you meet different characters who join your party, which can be rather amusing. However if you pay close attention you will run across dialogue they speak doesn't match up with what is typed out on the screen.\n\nFurthermore some of your party members you learn a great deal about who they are but others you are left with cryptic messages about their past and only to find out later it was removed from the game due to time constraints, which is a huge disappointment.\n\nThe other problem with this game is the fact there are not too many side quests and it seems you are more forced to do the main storyline then to actually explorer the world. If you take a look at the map you see so many areas that could have been added in the game. For example one such area later on is called \"Leeves\" a gnome village, but you are not able to travel there, such a shame.\n\nEven more so the enemies' in this game are rather poor, there is a huge range of enemies in the Dungeons and Dragons world, yet you are only able to combat not even close to a third of them. Most of the time the game time is spent; fighting thugs, Watch guards (if you go evil), animals, and standard demons such as Succubus and imps, undead, shadows, Ogres, Orcs, Bugbears. Goblins you won't see until Act II and common enemies' like vampires don't appear until Act III. The only giants that are in this game are Fire Giants and you only encounter a few dragons.\n\nThe main storyline isn't too bad filled with holes that leave you scratching your head. The ending of the game was terrible. They should have allowed you to continue on playing the game. For example if you go evil and join the main villain you should be allowed to do missions for them or if you choose to be good continue onwards doing good deeds.\n\nRomance in this game was another issue they were very sloppy on. I liked the fact my female character was involved with the paladin, Cassivir, but again, cryptic messages from him and you only were able to choose to be involved with him at the end of the game. Would have been nice to have this happen earlier in the game allowing it evolve over the game's time span. If your going to add romance in the game, either go all out with it like in the game Fable, or just don't add it in at all.\n\nThe game isn't horrible but it could have been much better. I just felt this game was put poorly together without too much thought put in it but with only thought of we have to get this out on the market.

Scroll back to the upper left corner of this product's web page to see them.\n\nI'll address the issue of the metal rivet first. Yes, there is a metal rivet at the bottom of the PSP compartment. However, my case has a bit of material over it and the rivet does not come into contact with my PSP (see product image). I know that some reviewers have cases with bare metal rivets so I assume that this is a correction made by the company or there was a batch of cases where somebody forgot to put the covers in.\n\nThe other complaint is about fitting a PSP inside of the case. It fits and I invite you to check out my product image to see for yourself. However, it is very snug (see image). I have all linds of gizmos from pocket camcorders to cameras to multiple game consoles and I have never seen a case where the product fits so tightly. I was able to hold the case upside down and gently shook it and the console did not fall out. (Don't try this!) I had to wonder if this was intended for a PSP 3000.\n\nWhile the console does fit, the shoulder buttons will be pushed into the console. I was able to squeeze a few UMDs into the other compartment and close it. This case can hold up to four UMDs along with the system.\n\nThe case is a hard rubber but you can still squeeze it. I'd compare it to somewhere between a travel case for your razors and toothbrushes and those generic rubber camera cases you can find at WalMart. If you put your PSP into this case and then put the case into a messenger bag then your system will be well protected.\n\nI paid $6.29 for this case and I'd say that it does its job but I am not comfortable storing my PSP with the shoulder buttons squeezed in.

It is an unusual little book as it is a story from a seagull's point of view.\n\nThe book was written by Richard Bach (b. 1936). A former US Air Force pilot, many of his books contain flight references. The book is very short - about 100 pages - many of which comprise photographs of gulls. It caused quite a stir when it was first published in 1970. This best seller is a classic and is still on many schools' reading lists.\n\nThe story is about Jonathan's passion to fly like no other seagull against all odds. He is different from other gulls who exist merely to eat and survive. He wants to learn to fly higher and faster than anyone else. He constantly improves by teaching himself new techniques. Each time he `fails' he moves to a higher level of awareness.\n\nHe eventually reaches a plane where he finds many gulls with the same mindset. He is encouraged and motivated to continue to excel and ultimately learns to fly beyond his wildest expectations. His self development and personal growth keep him focused on his search for a higher purpose, and through persistence and perseverance he finally achieves his goal.\n\nAs his reputation builds so does a `following' but he remains humble, speaking of simple things, such as  \"the right for a gull to fly\"  and  \"freedom.\" His followers consider him  \"special and gifted and divine, above all other birds.\"  He explains to them that they all are. There are some great phrases like:\n\n\"The gull who sees farthest who flies highest\".\n\"Everything that limits us we have to put aside\".\n\"You need to keep finding yourself, a little more each day...\".\n\"...you have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way\".\n\nThis novel is about attaining your dreams and being your own self development mentor. Jonathan shows that through sheer tenacity and perseverance you can overcome obstacles and achieve your goals. On a deeper level, it explores man's inherent desire for personal development and self growth, and the search for true happiness. Deeper still, it touches on our materialistic life being not the end but the beginning of something even greater.\n\nAs you read you realise that Jonathan Seagull lives within everyone. What are his teachings?\n\n* Live and love your life's passions.\n* Give yourself the freedom to soar.\n* Never ever give up on your passions.\n* Allow yourself to listen to your heart.\n* Have faith and pursue your true purpose.\n* You can do anything if you want it enough.\n* Follow your dreams through thick and thin.\n* Dare to question what is taught by your elders.\n* It is all right to be different from everyone else.\n* Do not follow others blindly - fly out on your own.\n* Keep working on your talents and fly to new heights.\n* It is your choice to live your life exactly the way you want.\n* Follow your dreams even if others find your ideas ridiculous.\n* Break through the restraints of family, friends and community.\n* Figure out what your greatest talents are and truly live your life.\n* Hard as it may sound, do not be concerned over what others think.\n* There is always something great to be learned from trying new things.\n* Listen to your dreams and persevere until you get to where you want to be.\n\nIN SUMMARY\n\n'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' is about far more than the life of one seagull. It is a fable about self empowerment and the importance of seeking a higher purpose in life, even if the people around you find your goals threatening or ridiculous. Jonathan shows that you can do anything and be anything you want if you just believe in yourself. It is also about the struggle to find the answers about life itself.\n\nThis book is a great read for all age-groups and particularly for anyone who wants to `fly' in the broadest sense of the word.

Many players bought this game and are still playing today. However, I am not in the magical group of players and believe that this game gets old quick. This game is a routine game; once you realize you are doing the same thing over and over, again you will stop playing.\n\nGraphics- 5/10\nAs you probably already know, the graphics for this game are horrible. I'm not saying they needed to great, but they could've been a little better. The game was originally made for the Nintendo 64, which actually explains it's poor graphics. You also are stuck in a top down view that really restricts what you can see most of the time. Looking for other characters is a task because the view is so annoying. There aren't many load times though, so you can move throughout the small world quickly. The ugly graphics can be forgiven, as they don't really affect the gameplay any.\n\nStory- 4/10\nThere really is no story in this game. You have hopped on a train heading for a town. You have pretty much no money. Luckily for you, Tom Nook quickly offers you a tiny home to live in. He allows you to make payments on it. From that point on there is no story. You just visit with other critters in the world and talk to them. There is nothing going on to keep you interested in the game. All you do is pay Tom Nook money and buy things from his shop. You are truly free in this game, but I wish a little bit of a story were added.\n\nSound- 4/10\nThe game's sound is almost unbearable. The music is probably the only thing you can deal with on the game. Even then, it is usual an annoying tune that gets old quick. The characters talk in a weird language that is more annoying than the Sims. I suggest turning the animal language off in the beginning of the game. You will get so sick of hearing the way they talk.\n\nGameplay- 6/10\nYou need to collect cash to pay off Tom Nook. At first you will run a few errands for him that will act like more of a tutorial. After that you are on your own. You can furnish your home, run errands for people, and a few other things. Once you have paid off your house, you can upgrade it a few more times to get bigger and add extra floors. This is all fun for a couple weeks. Eventually you will realize that this is a routine game. You do the same thing every time you turn on the game. You check your mail, run errands, fish, sell everything, pay off Nook, save and quit. This gets really tedious once you get to the really expensive upgrades.\n\nYou can have up to four people in a town though. If you have a couple other people to play with the game will become a lot better. If you have a town created on another memory card that is in slot two, you will be able to travel to that town and buy things from their shop. Trading fruit between towns can lead to a huge profit. You can even wreak havoc in another person's town by digging holes and leaving garbage lying around. It's up to you. Having a couple friends to play this with can really add to this game longevity.\n\nDifficulty- 5/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)\nThere is no skill required to play this game. The only hard part about this game is paying off Tom's insane fees. Other than that there are no hard parts. Finding items for the Museum may be difficult, but at the end of the day you only have to dig up whatever is there. If it isn't there then you wait until the next day. The game wasn't meant to be difficult though, so I will give it an average score in this section of scoring. The fact that the game is so easy helps if you want a bunch of friend's to play the game with you.\n\nOverall- 6/10\nI will admit that the game is pretty fun for the first few weeks. Once you hit point where you owe Tom around 700,000 bells (currency), you will realize that you are going to have to do the same tedious things over again to get enough money for it. You can probably play this game an hour or so a day and be done with it in a few weeks. I can only recommend purchasing this game if you have a couple friends that are willing to play this game with you. If not then just avoid this all together.

In Britain of that time, that was all that they could do.  Their father's estate was entailed, which means that most of it automatically passed to their half-brother.  Women in that time were not educated beyond basic literacy and numeracy, and most well-paying occupations were closed to them by either law or custom.  In a Catholic country (say, Spain or Italy) young ladies in the Dashwood girls' position would have had the option of becoming nuns, but in Protestant Britain even that was not an option--it was marriage or nothing.\n\nDid Jane's unpitying, but nonjudgmental, portrayal of this situation lead to the nascient feminist movement of the later 19th century, which saw educational and occupational opportunities for women open up and legal reforms that enabled women to control their own money and property?  Perhaps, indirectly; certainly her novels brought the situation to people's minds, and probably got them thinking about it far more than more polemical writings would have.\n\nI did think that the one sister's mooning after Willoughby got a bit tiresome, but I think it was supposed to be.  And, after he lead the other sister on so much and then allowed her to think that he'd married someone else (the someone else married his brother--nice bit of casting, the actor who played the brother did look enough like Hugh Grant to be his less-handsome brother) and then came calling to propose that she should have taken one of the pewter candlesticks on the table and whapped him upside the head with it before accepting the proposal.\n\nMy father has four sisters, and says that the way the girls bickered and fussed at each other is absolutely on target.\n\nAs for some of the actors/actresses being too old for their parts, remember that in those days people didn't live as long as they do now.  In terms of life-stage they were right; a modern performer of the chronological age of the book's characters would be too immature.\n\nMy main quarrel with this movie was the music.  Not the music itself, which I liked (it was specially composed, but sounded period; the main theme, for example, sounded like a snippit from a Beethoven piano concerto) but the performance.  The piano used was obviously a modern instrument; pianos of the period had a thinner, lighter, sound than modern ones do--the fortepiano was marked, after all, as an enhanced harpsichord.

Why KISS ever departed from just playing good rock music is another story, but obviously with \"Unmasked\" they were searching for something else. As goofy as some of it is, it's still KISS and it eventually grew on me in the day as my little 8-track player blasted the tunes. And just like \"The Elder,\" I have the CD and still listen to it, maybe perhaps because they are so different. But even with bad material, it still contains Paul Stanley's incredible voice and Ace Frehley on lead guitar. And some are the tunes aren't bad, even if they are pop tunes. I will say this - the production and engineering on this album is awful. I would love to hear some of these tunes with a harder edge and good guitar tones - kinda' like the first time you heard some of the live versions of tunes off the first KISS albums on \"Alive.\" My other main criticism is that some of the lyrics are simply horrendous - beyond silly.\n\n1. Is That You - this could have been a really rocking song. Still not a bad KISS track.\n\n2. Shandi - great pop tune.\n\n3. Talk To Me - Has to have the most words ending in \"tion\" ever written. Great Ace lead vocal and backgrounds from Paul and Gene. I've always liked this song, vapid as the lyrics are.\n\n4. Naked City - Gene's first track on the album. Not great, but tons better that some of the stuff of his KISS solo album. Listenable.\n\n5. What Makes The World Go 'Round - A Paul disco tune. His vocal makes this song. Again, not classic KISS, but not a bad tune for what it is. Ace adds some cool riffs.\n\n6. Tomorrow - I've always liked this Paul tune, might be my favorite track. Could have been on his solo album. Another tune that could have totally rocked - damn you, Vinnie Poncia!\n\n7. Two Sides Of The Coin - Perhaps one of Ace's worse songs ever. \"Then you decide to pick a mate, because you're tired of all of those dates.\" Good lord.\n\n8. She's So European - A Gene new wave tune, complete with Cars-like synthesizer. I don't mind this tune at all - makes me want to dance like Dieter from \"Sprockets.\"\n\n9. Easy As It Seems - not a great Paul tune. But the guy sings so friggin' well it ain't bad, either. If you want to dance to a KISS tune, not a bad choice - it has the beat.\n\n10. Torpedo Girl - Classic Ace tune with some good guitar. Just ignore him shouting \"C'mon and get your feet wet.\"\n\n11. You're All That I Want - Gene closes out the album with a tune that would have fit nicely on his solo album. Not a demon song, but not a bad pop tune, either.\n\nI don't know, I like this album better that most of the post-makeup stuff when KISS took another turn and tried to be hair metal. Even though Peter Criss does not play or sing on the album, it still seems to come across as a true classic KISS album.

Ostensibly about the trials and tribulations of a Venetian shipping entrepreneur and his circle of friends, the real subject of interest has long been Shylock, one of Shakespeare's most famous and controversial characters.\n\nWas Shakespeare ripping into an already persecuted minority, the Jews of Europe, by showcasing Shylock's twisted desire for vengeance in this, a play from around the time of his mature middle period, the late 1590s? Or was he deftly attacking the persecutors, by giving his villain a human face and holding up a mirror to the supposedly \"gentle\" Gentiles, a pun frequently presented in the text?\n\nI don't know. I know I was uncomfortable reading \"Merchant In Venice\", uncomfortable with the realization that even if Shakespeare wasn't anti-Semitic himself, he was writing to entertain an anti-Semitic audience with forced conversions and legalized theft. Yes, Shylock delivers his famous speech about the humanity of Jews: \"If you prick us, do we not bleed?\" But his ruin in Act IV is pitilessly celebrated all the same, by a group that includes Shylock's own daughter Jessica, a positively presented character who joins her Christian friends in calling her father \"the Jew\".\n\nAlas, the language of this morally squalid play is beautiful throughout, especially in Act V, where ribald puns about horns and rings and some engaging banter between the otherwise unengaging leads remind one of Shakespeare's greatest comedies. But there's also a substantial boredom factor, like the repetitive tediousness of a casket-choosing contest Portia puts her wooers through and the droning goodness of bland Antonio, the nominal lead character. A promising clown, Launcelot Gobbo, has one funny scene with his \"more than sand blind, high-gravel blind\" father before slipping into the background.\n\nMy old Signet edition has an introduction by Kenneth Myrick that offers an interesting interpretation. As Myrick presents it, the core issue here is not Jew vs. Christian but narrow-minded legalisms vs. affairs of the heart. \"The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps over cold decrees,\" observes Portia.\n\nBut that's subtext. To get to subtext, one must wrestle with assorted jeers at Shylock for the crime of his faith, not to mention the inanity of Antonio's situation, putting himself in debt for a friend who, it turns out, really didn't need the money.\n\nI never liked \"Merchant Of Venice\", but I never really hated it. It's a glass half-full/half-empty kind of thing. There's enough dimension to Shylock to discredit the notion of him as a mere ethnic whipping boy, just not enough to make one believe Shakespeare intended a sympathetic interpretation. Even the harshest scene in the play, for those of us who feel sympathy for Shylock, the one where he is denied his famous pound of flesh, contains Portia's great soliloquy about \"the quality of mercy\", not to mention a tense and clever courtroom drama.\n\n\"Merchant Of Venice\" is not one of Shakespeare's best plays. It is fine in parts, however, and interesting throughout, a reflection of ugly people in an ugly time that captivates you with moments of true beauty.", "sat my sister down and we watched batman vs robin half the movie was her sobbing the other half was her staring in horror and shock", "One of the levels came loose and broke off", "I was pretty happy to find these wheels sets for my cart.

It focused on Delia, a woman who can communicate with stone statues. She's been called back to her hometown, because the family manor has burned with her father inside. Her dad survived, but was badly injured and requires costly care. Grant Wolverton, a successful businessman and childhood crush, offers to buy the ancestral home. And though Delia doesn't want to let it go, she has to accept, in order to pay the medical bills. She stays on with the estate, though, to help renovate the house and she and Grant grow closer.\n\nIt took me awhile to get into the story. Delia's relationship with her dad has always been rocky, so the statues are really her only family. I know her communication with them is supposed to be charming, but it was really kind of hokey. Delia comes across as awkward and kind of naive. The very best thing this book has going for it are the sex scenes, which are pretty darn hot and fortunately plentiful. Sadly, the actual relationship between Delia and Grant is frustrating. She is clearly crazy about the guy, but every time he tries to initiate more than a roll in the hay, she pulls away from him. A relationship with Grant is what her dreams are made of, but she keeps a wall between them. And she blames him because he doesn't believe the statues talk to her. (Well, duh!)\n\nObviously, Delia and Grant have enough problems between them. But there is the additional foil of Delia's succubus cousin. She wants Grant and the old house. But I never really saw her as much of a threat, since Grant barely looked at her twice.\n\nIt was kind of hard for me to keep all the statue characters straight. And I didn't entirely get the epilogue. (Who the heck are the Hardcastles?) I give the author credit for trying to find a unique theme, but it just didn't work for me. 2 1/2 stars.

He's more the product of poor parenting (that's putting it mildly).  I haven't seen everything Stewart Gordon has done, but I've seen enough to know he always had the potential to make a less than stellar film.  \"Castle Freak\" is the evidence.  The title of this film conjures up so many ghoulishly delightful images in ones mind.  My imagination had all kinds of demented scenarios for this film.  None of them were quite as lifeless as this.  While trying to figure out why this film fizzled, the only honest reason I could come up with is that Stewart Gordon got sloppy and/or lazy.  All the elements for a fun horror film were at his disposal and he muffed it.  Let's break down what he had and what he did with it:\n\n-CREEPY ENVIRONMENT\nApparently this was shot on the same setting as \"Pit and the Pendulum\".  Even the exterior looks just unkempt enough to garner doubt about its security.  Much of \"Freak\" takes place in the sufficiently dank dark corners of the cellar.  Nearly the rest takes place in a pub, the rustic kitchen, a bedroom and the \"Castle\" ramparts (topside).  This is limited but sufficient if used properly.\n\n-GRUESOME CREATURE EFFECTS\nYea, this \"Freak\" is a glorious mess.  They used full body makeup for reasons an explanation would spoil.  Gordon never had bad makeup and prosthetic people in any film I've seen.  Plenty of blood gets smeared around too.\n\n-TRIED AND TRUE CAST\nJeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton are Gordon veterans by the time this gets made.  They both proved highly enjoyable in their previously campy, but convincing roles.  Nobody else hurt this film with bad acting.\n\n-A FAIR CONCEPT\nThe results of life long neglect and abuse on the loose; what more could you ask for.\n\n-THE RESULTS (some mild spoilers, no plot conveyed)\nI think the first problem I had with this film is that it's played too straight.  Because of this, Combs is completely out of his element.  He's not good enough an actor to pull of a leading man role in a straight horror film without looking incapable.  Everyone else did a fair job considering they were given nothing to do.  Another unwelcome result of playing it straight; it got a little boring.  Despite some nasty sexual situations (in one, Combs looks porno bad) and an adequate body count, none of it was unique or particularly well staged. The pacing just languished in the attempt at a deep, emotional story. There were some thought provoking psychological situations here, but not enough to keep it going.  With the lack of humor, the copious blood was simply gratuitous where in other Gordon films it heightened the fun gross-out factor.\n\nI like horror played straight, but Stewart Gordon just didn't do a good job of it here.  The actual \"Freak\" was an abomination.  Though you should feel sympathy, you simply want him dead to end his demented suffering and horrific acts.  The chases were clumsy, the action mediocre and fairly unimaginative and the mistakes glaring. Check out Combs running up the castles tower staircase.  As the stone steps turns to wood, his foot-falls still sound like stone.  Check out the blind daughter falling down into the cellar.  When she reaches the bottom, her cane falls wildly behind her.  She cusses at her violent tumble and scrapes, then quickly turns and reaches for her cane; BULLS EYE!!  In a film played for camp, this is forgivable and actually funny. In this attempt, it came off as inept.  Of course, many films make mistakes; but I don't usually notice them so easily.  I like Stewart Gordon's \"bite me\" attitude, and I love his more campy efforts; they are gruesome, shocking, imaginative and fun.  I think he discovered playing it straight is not his strength.  I can't say this film is all that fun, scary or enjoyable on any level, though disturbing it can be.  For the curious, a rental will do.  I can't recommend you buy it though.\n\n-Concept....3.5 stars\n-Players.....3 stars\n-Creature...3.5 stars\n-Script.......2 stars\n-Effort......2 stars\n\n2.8 Stars.", "SEEMED TO BE OKAY FOR IMPORTED STUFF LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN TODAYS WORLD", "The strategy behind playing Madrid & Milan on the Tues & Wednesday before a Saturday game @ Old Trafford?Was it a few quid for DL to trouser", "Lining was very thin.", "@AMunro92 \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7is a combination of St. George, Patrick & Andrew for Scotland and if Scotlands no involved why would they still have St. Andrew?", "\"Horror Rises From the Tomb\" (\"El Espanto surge de la tumba\") begins with a prologue in 15th century France, when a knight is beheaded for being a warlock. Five hundred years later the head is dug up, comes back to life, starts possessing people, and uses them to do all sorts of horrible things like ritualistic sacrifices, not to mention searching for the rest of his body. This 1973 Spanish splatter flick comes from first-time director Carlos Aured, who does little besides point the camera in the right direction. The gore level is certainly well above average, especially for the time period, in terms of decapitations and disembowelments, but that is pretty much all \"Horror Rises From the Tomb\" has to recommend itself. The only other attraction here is cult actor Paul Naschy (a.k.a. Jacinto Molina, Paul Mackey, so on and so forth) who plays not just Ulric du Marnac, but Hugo du Marnac and Armand du Marnac.  Although he had bit parts in films like \"King of Kings\" and \"55 Days at Peking,\" Naschy was more at home in cheap horror films such as \"The Werewolf's Shadow\" and \"Curse of the Devil\" (to limit the discussion to films still available). He certainly has more presence than anybody else in this film. The plot is negligle, but, gee, burying the warlock's head on the own estate seems like such a really big mistake now, does it not?.

Android system is getting better by leaps and bounds. I have a machine shop so I needed protection for the Razr and I had the Otter Box defender on my 3GS.

The reason is the phone ends up on the floor trying to ungrip it from the holster! You have to pry it away and off the 4 bumps in the plastic holster that grip the 4 depressions on the case. And forget about grabbing the phone and separating it from the holster with your free hand. It's 50/50 whether you'll hang on to it or it will just shoot out of the holster onto the floor. My cure in the IPhone defender was to buy a Seidio holster, it has a top clip to hold it in that's easy to operate and take the phone out. The down side is the Seidio has a fragile belt clip that will break say if you sit down in a car and its vertical. Any outward push with enough force and its gone. I am ordering a Seidio active case holster combo and hope the holster will also work with my Otter Box defender case. I'll have to watch the belt clip problem and keep my receipt incase it breaks.

Why the good paint job and not a few seconds of grinding to make a good flat surface on the business side of the clamp. i had read a review where someone actually filed on the clamps and thought that was a little exaggerated but after using them and putting several hundred pounds of pressure on them, it actually left eggshape indentations on some redwood table top glueups and i now understand filing them.

In Without Remorse, the love interest's death is only exploited to give Clark an excuse to kill everyone.

Great, now here is what you do: program your CD player to only the odd tracks and prepare yourself for a great listening experience.\nYes, there are really only 6 good songs on this album of 11 songs, and they are all the odd numbered songs.\nTrack one, In Too Deep, is probably the best song on the album. Classic Belinda, sounds like a hybrid of her songs from her Real and Live Your Life Be Free albums. The rhythm to this song is infectious. Throughout all of Belinda's albums, I love how her voice quivers when she hits her notes. Her voice hits all those notes on In Too Deep. She really can turn a simple sylabble into something memorable.\nA Woman & A Man is a pretty good song. I guess my only complaint with the song is the line \"Could it be you, yes it was you, a woman and a man.\" Sadly that's during the chorus so it occurs a lot. Otherwise the choppy and distorted guitars and thoughtful lyrics make this a memorable song.\nListen to Love is a decent song. Not too catchy musically except when a cool drumline arrives when Belinda sings \"Come on now\" repeatedly a couple times during the song. The chorus is pretty good. Yeah, a decent song.\nLove Doesn't Live Here probably is In Too Deep's biggest rival for best song of the album. I absolutely love the guitars on this song but the song shines on some of the best lyrics she's ever sung. The ending to the song is simply phenomenal. There is an immense sense of sadness during the last part of the song. Wow. This could bring a tear to your eye.\nKneel At Your Feet is a quirky song because the chorus could have a lot of different meanings. I think I heard one person say it was religious but couldn't it easily be sexual as well? It's a good track because Belinda's voice is simply phenomenal during the chorus and there is some entertaining funky music. Probably the worst of the odd numbered songs but this song is still way better than any even numbered song on the album.\nMy Heart Goes Out To You ends the album nicely. A depressing song but with a tender touch from Belinda.\nA Woman & A Man isn't Belinda's worst solo album. That honor would go to her self-titled album where she only has 4, maybe 5 good songs and even then none of those songs can rival In Too Deep and Love Doesn't Live Here.

What attracted me to this book was the original sounding blurb, and this certainly is one of the strong points of this book. The story is very original and if you have enough of vampires being romantized you should pick up this book, the vampires here are mostly evil and aggressive.\n\nThe prequel of this book realy captured my attention and immediately I was interested in reading more about this special blood. Too bad that after the prequel the story starts off a bit slow. It took me some time to get into the story. The story itself was interesting and I really liked the idea of a boy having blood that has such strange effects. So the story was good, but I still feel like something was missing. I also expected the focus to be more on Jerry's strange blood and them running from people who wanted it, but instead the focus was more on the action and fighting.\n\nThis book is full of action, a bit too much for my taste. And the story contains many arguments and screaming between the characters. Also I think there was a bit too much info about guns and cars, expecially when you are not interested in things like that. I did thought the book was nice read, it was kinda refreshing to see evil vampires and big fights for a change. It also it obvious that a male had written it and it has a male POV, for those who are interested in that. It also has a bit of a dark feel to it.\n\nAnother thing that captured my attention was the strange POV. It mostly is told from Jerry's POV, but more in a way like someone else sees it all happening and also other persons POV are described. And there where some sentences like: character X acted like that, but Jerry didn't notice it. I think this was a bit strange, but luckily sentences like that weren't used that often.\n\nThen I still want to say a bit about the characters and the world building. In my opinion the world building was very limited, we get to know a bit about the vampires and hear there are other things out there, but not much more. I would've liked seeing more world building, but I also think that maybe it wouldn't really fit in with the rest of the story. I just wished we would've gotten a bit more of the overal picture.\n\nNow about the characters, I did like the characters, but again there was something missing. I couldn't really connect with the characters, they didn't seem like people I would like knowing. I also didn't like the way the characters quickly went over to arguments and screaming and being a bit too emotional and dramatic at times. We did get an idea what went on in jerry's head, but I still didn't like him. I also think he made some rushed and stupid descisions.\n\nTo conclude: a nice and original book, but not really a book for me. It contained a bit too less world building and character depth and too much focus on the action, agression, guns and cars. It certainly has an original plot, but somehow it just isn't my type of book.", "didn't work as well as I hoped.", "Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.

Not the best story or the best acting for either, but fun if you are a fan of either him or Hepburn.", "By the time \"The Wall\" was released in 1979, Pink Floyd, for better or for worse, was firmly within the creative control of bassist/vocalist/imperious principal songwriter Roger Waters, and as such were not much more than his own backing musicians, with their musical aspirations clearly relegated to afterthought status in comparison to those of Waters.\n\nWhen it worked (as it did the \"Animals\" and \"The Wall\"), the results were spectacular.  When it did NOT work (as with \"The Final Cut\" and pretty much every solo album Roger Waters has released since separating from Pink Floyd), AT BEST Waters' efforts are strictly hit-and-miss.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" is, firstly, largely made up of songs that were intially culled from \"The Wall\".  It is obvious by listening to the songs, either from the lyrics or the sound effects included with the recordings (the dog tags, the TV stations consistently changing)...\"The Postwar Dream\", \"When The Tigers Broke Free\" (actually written for and appearing in the movie \"Pink Floyd The Wall\", it would be more at home on \"The Wall\", but as it is one of the most touching songs Waters has ever written, I am just thankful that it has finally been released on anything save a \"Best Of\" compilation), and \"The Final Cut\" are the songs most obviously missing from \"The Wall\" that make up some of the stronger efforts from this album.\n\nAnd that's the problem.  Guitarist David Gilmour's argument against releasing them was pretty simple; if they weren't good enough to release in 1979, what made them good enough to release in 1983?  The answer, unfortunately, is that the rest of the material on this album -while unquestionably dear to Waters' heart- simply isn't that strong.  And by shutting out the contributions of Gilmour, keyboardist Rick Wright (sacked before recording even began), and drummer Nick Mason (sacked before the album could be completed), Waters essentially released \"The Final Cut\" as his first solo album; the strongest effort, \"Not Now John\", is also the one track where Gilmour's influence is felt the most.\n\nUltimately, the reason this album failed to resonate despite the terrific production values (almost anything Michael Kamen lends his name to is quality work; his efforts here are no exception) lies not with the artist's presentation but with his vision; it is a far more personal album that the listener, unless he or she is a socially disenfranchised British liberal rock star who has lost a parent to a war and whose family is in a state of disarray of its own, PROBABLY isn't going to be able to relate to regardless of how well the songwriting (which is subpar for Pink Floyd but not resoundingly poor) or production (which is amazing; this is a magnificent CD to listen to with headphones; a SACD/DTS 5:1 version of this, like any Pink Floyd album, would be extremely well-received).\n\nAnd the tone of the album is just SO depressing.  In a lot of ways it can be compared, both in its hodgepodge/piecemeal composition AS WELL AS knowing that its creators were falling apart as it was being recorded, with the Beatles' \"Let It Be\".  But even \"Let It Be\" had some uplifting moments...\"The Final Cut\" begins with a lamentation that a father's ultimate sacrifice \"for King and Country\" was in vain with the subsequent direction the country has taken and ends with nuclear war.  This is not the CD you want to put on to liven up a party or if you're struggling with depression.\n\nIt's good enough...and \"When The Tigers Broke Free\" is a nice addition...but while this album would be a decent enough effort from anyone else (and as a Roger Waters solo album it tops anything else he's done, for what that's worth), Pink Floyd under better -or even tolerably friendly- conditions can top this easily.  \"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\", released only four years later without Waters' participation at all, proves this most ably.", "Looking at this Cold War film from a distance of half a century, much of the content and the sentiments seem terribly outdated.  As a piece of filmmaking, TOPAZ certainly has atmosphere, with good use of various locations - even though I suspect the Cuban scenes were filmed elsewhere.

She said that's why HP is suing to stop him from working at Oracle.\n The ties between the two companies were fraying before Hurd's hiring  as Oracle is muscling in on HP's turf by starting to sell computing hardware.\n Oracle's naming of Hurd as a co-president is a thumb in HP's eye -- assuming Oracle isn't eventually blocked from letting him work. Many legal experts believe that HP's case will be hard to win  because California courts tend to side with workers and their right to take their skills to rival companies.\n Hurd abruptly resigned last month from HP after five years as CEO  in the wake of a sexual-harassment investigation that turned up inaccurate expense reports connected to his accuser. Ellison loudly came to Hurd's defense.\n HP will need an order from the California court where it filed its lawsuit to stop Hurd from working for Oracle.

Yes, it is easily opened with one hand, but it seems that's where the convenience ends. If you want to use any of the assorted tools, it's somewhat labor intensive. First, you have to open the tool cover, select the tool you want, then pull it into the open position.\n\nThe problem I have stems from the fact that not all of the tools are easily opened individually. Pull one open and several of the others come out too. Depending on what tools come out, you have to be careful when pushing the unneeded tools back so as not to cut yourself. And no, I didn't, but it was close... ;-)\n\nI am way less than impressed with the locking mechanism. You have to make a conscious effort to ensure that any given tool is actually locked. Yes, another close call. By contrast, the tools on my Gerber are all easily accessible and are locked into position with (in my opinion) a better locking mechanism. In all it's years of use, I never had a single tool fail to lock automatically nor has the locking mechanism ever failed. Given, too, is the fact the with the Gerber, although it does take two hands to open a tool, I can unlock, put the tool away, retract the pliers and re-holster it single handedly.\n\nNow, I honestly bought this truly wanting to like it.

His baton yields too chiseled and angular a line, reduces the magic of Mozart's flow from aria to aria and to ensemble to a sharp inflection that can be painful at times.  How can anyone match Cesare Siepi?  The ultimate Don Giovanni and the most balanced and magnificent Figaro.

Below, more of my impressions - with some limited SPOILERS about \"Spoilers\")))\n\nThe story takes place in Nome, Alaska in 1900, in full gold rush. Following on the trail of first prospectors and miners numerous shady characters (\"spoilers\") arrived to Alaska, to steal most interesting claims by force, ruse or legal artifice. One of such claims, in fact a prosperous gold mine, belongs to Roy Glennister (John Wayne) and Al Dextry (Harry Carey) and their silent partner, saloon owner Cherry Malotte (Marlene Dietrich). Cherry and Glennister are also more or less in a relationship  albeit it is a stormy one\n\nKnowing that they will be targeted by the \"spoilers\" the three partners are concerned for their claim, but hope that things will improve with the arrival of a new gold commissioner Alexander McNamara (Randolph Scott) and a new judge. However, the judge also brings with him his niece, Helen Chester (Margaret Lindsay), an educated, classy, sweet young thing. Glennister immediately falls for her - hard! In retaliation Cherry shows some responsiveness to McNamara's advances And that is only the beginning of troubles\n\nWell, you can immediately see that it is an old film, when John Wayne is billed third))) But in fact this was already the FOURTH screen adaptation of the 1906 novel \"The spoilers\" written by Rex Beach. This book, which was one of bestsellers in 1906, was based partly on real events and the character of Alexander McNamara is based on a real man, Alexander McKenzie. This corrupt official indeed tried to steal gold mines from their legal owners in Nome in 1900, albeit in the real life no violence was involved (he ended by going to jail  but served only little time). As for the character of Roy Glennister it is very, very distantly based on Japhet Lindeberg, one of \"Three Lucky Swedes\" who were amongst the most famous (and most fortunate) prospectors during the gold rush.\n\nThis is a really good film. It aged surprisingly little in 73 years and is still a darn good watch. All five main actors offer a great show, but this film has also many colourful secondary characters, beginning with Idabelle (Marietta Canty), Cherry's black maid  who in fact is more of a confidante and also occasionally a kind of partner in crime...))) John Wayne is excellent in this film and Randolph Scott offers all his snaky charm  and menace When those two finally clash, their fistfight is nothing short of epic Veteran actor Harry Carey is excellent as a no-nonsense old timer who trusts his faithful rifle more than lawyers  and honestly, it is hard to blame him))) Young Margaret Lindsay plays very well a \"fille fatale\"  an ultimately-not-so-nice deceptively sweet seemingly innocent girl\n\nIt is however Marlene Dietrich who shines the most in \"Spoilers\". I always liked those old films which were as full of sex as today, but because nothing could be shown, everything had to be suggested  and here we have a masterful display of those techniques. Innuendos, double-entendres, looks full of meaning, tricks of lights and shadows, musical moments, camera moving away in strategically chosen scenes  all is here Those scenes in which Marlene Dietrich navigates between two attractive males, teasing them, toying with them and occasionally verbally biting them, are a real treasure. Incidentally, Marlene Dietrich and John Wayne were in the same time having a real life affair  and that helped in creating screen chemistry between them\n\nBottom line, this is a good, solid old western, still very watchable, with a lot of excellent dialogs, humour, tension, drama and one of the most famous fistfights in all history in cinema.

Between taking my mind off what I was doing, and raising my adrenaline levels, it made for some intense workouts.\n\nIt was based on the TV series, which I never saw, so I don't have a basis for comparison.\n\nThe plot is fairly simple. Vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford) returns home and finds his wife murdered. He's arrested, tried, and convicted of the crime, but ends up escaping when a prison transport bus crashes. U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is in charge of the task force hunting for him. Dr. Kimball realizes that the only way to help himself is to discover who really killed his wife--the one-armed man--and who's behind it.\n\nThere's a perfect balance here between chase scenes, suspense, and unraveling clues. The chase scenes and the more static suspense scenes didn't drag on until (as happens far too frequently) I got fatigued, and the detective work by both sides wasn't a series of boring sitting-and-thinking scenes, either.\n\nAside: note to filmmakers: regardless of the type of scene, if it goes on too long, it gets boring (yes, including sex scenes--I've watched enough boring porn movies to know).\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the movie stars Tommy Lee Jones, either. Or that he fit the role perfectly. As did Harrison Ford. Though Dr. Kimball was a less exciting character, it made sense that he'd behave the way Ford portrayed him--bewildered, angry, completely out of his depth, but smart and determined. So much so that for a space of time I could believe it wasn't a movie at all.\n\nIt's one of my favorites, and one I don't mind re-watching over and over again.", "Dogs don't even want to go NEAR the trash--neither does my husband in his stocking feet!!!", "With all due respect to Michael Jackson, I always believed that Elton John is more deserving of the title \"King of Pop.\"  Both performers have endured their share of artistic and personal ups and downs, but while Jacko has recently morphed into self-parody, Sir Elton still churns out freshly-crafted pop (as evidenced on his excellent \"Songs from the West Coast\").  I'm excited as the next Elton fan that we now have a double-disc greatest hits album spanning his entire career, but let's be honest: it's not as comprehensive as it could have been.  There are enough omissions on this recording to warrant a third disc: \"Blue Eyes,\" \"Empty Garden,\" \"A Word in Spanish,\" \"In Neon,\" \"Kiss the Bride,\" and so forth.  Also, the disc completely ignores the albums \"Victim of Love\" and \"Leather Jackets,\" which is a smart move since both records were easily among his least inspired.  But moving on, the material that DOES surface on this collection is, for the most part, mind-blowingly good.  Disc 1, which covers the 1970s, is utter perfection, a snapshot of classic, vintage Elton in peak form.  \"Your Song,\" \"Daniel,\" \"Tiny Dancer,\" \"Somebody Saved My Life Tonight,\" and \"Rocket Man\" form ample evidence that Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin were among the best songwriting teams of the 1970s.  Disc 2 (which covers 1980-2002) has some good stuff, but it's easily the lesser disc which has some decent tunes as well as a handful of not-so-great ones.  \"I'm Still Standing\" is still a winning tale of perseverence, while \"Sad Songs,\" \"I Guess That's Why They Call it the Blues,\" and \"Little Jeannie\" also stand out, too.  However, I wasn't a big fan of his work for \"The Lion King,\" and personally wasn't fond of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" and \"Circle of Life.\"  However, this disc closes on a great note with \"I Want Love\" and \"This Train Don't Stop Here Anymore,\" which are from 2001's \"Songs from the West Coast.\"  The limited edition has 4 tracks; the best of which is the live version of \"Candle in the Wind\" (NOT the tribute to Princess Diana) and his duet with George Michael \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.\"  Overall, I'm impressed with this hits collection, which comes with some really cool liner notes and nice photographs from his early years.  For a one stop guide to Elton's work, \"Greatest Hits 1970-2002\" is the way to go, warts and all.", "Was told to get this for whitening old appliances ...

I find as a rule, I tend to prefer the former, but the material needs to have a depth of arrangement to support this, or it needs to be significantly engaging to allow a drastic change.  Given that \"The Downward Spiral\" meets both these criteria, its little surprise that the remixes from it are quite strong-- in fact, of all the Nine Inch Nails remix material, I've found consistently high quality only amongst \"The Downward Spiral\" material.\n\nBefore I go on, the biggest complaint about this one is that there are tracks on here not on the UK release of \"Further Down the Spiral\" and vice versa.  Admittedly, it'd be tight to fit them all, but for completionists, you need the UK version for four further mixes.\n\nThe remixes on here are largely exercises in mood, many of the remixes take the original moods, usually anger, paranoia, depression, and add a heavy level of anticipation to it.  Take \"The Art of Self Destruction, Part One\" (remixed by the live Nine Inch Nails band circa 1995) or the overlong \"The Downward Spiral (the bottom)\" (remixed by Coil and Danny Hyde)-- both add a level of heightened anticipation to them that create a good pool of darkness from which the music can build.  But even better than these moody pieces are the Aphex Twin construction \"At the Heart of It All\", a stunning slice of orchestral ambient darkness constructed from samples from the album (don't ask me how), the endlessly varied \"Eraser\" remixes from Coil/Danny Hyde,  and the killer remix of \"Piggy (nothing can stop me now)\" by Rick Rubin, that takes the originals black mood and adds a level of aggression to it (with help of Dave Navarro's guitar) that actually surpasses the original and was added to Reznor's live set.\n\nThis is a great value as far as remix albums go, and well worth the investment for anyone who loved \"The Downward Spiral\".", "Fiskars makes strong, light weight trowels for the garden and all of the styles are terrific!

I have taken some unbelievable photos with this camera, ranging from animals to motocross.  Many of the photos look like they are magazine quality.  If you aren't used to a pro-quality lens (which I am not), you'll think this lens is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  In my amateur opinon, it seems to focus quickly (of course that depends on whether the item is close-up, lighting etc; can range from instant to a couple of seconds ... if you are trying to capture a fast-moving object, I DO recommend that you already have the focus in the approximate focus range, and then the lens will focus in about a 1/10th of a second).  So don't take a picture of a flower that is 5 feet away, and expect to instantly snap a picture of an Indy car flying by 50 feet away at 200MPH ... be ready for the Indy car, focus on the track before the car comes by, and you'll probably get an awesome shot!\n\nI'm not saying that every single shot turns out great - when zoomed to the max (especially if the conditions are cloudy or dark), a good number of my action shots were somewhat blurry.  Since I have the new Nikon D50 (digital SLR), if I snap 5 pictures and 3 of them are blurry I can instantly delete them (or delete them when I get home).  But if I had a film camera, I might not be quite as happy if I had to pay for developing some blurry pictures.\n\nThe actual zoom level is very good - I don't know the exact magnification level, but it is as much as you could want if you don't have the camera mounted on a tripod.  The construction seems very sturdy and \"professional\" looking - included is a nice \"hood\" that goes over the end of the lens, and makes you feel like a pro!\n\nIf you are professional wildlife photographer, and are seeking out the perfect photo of the extremely rare and endangered African-duckbilled-yellow-breasted-warbler, then pay $1,000 for a true pro-quality lens that can stabilize images, etc.  But if you are a weekend-warrior photographer who wants to be able to capture some pro-quality shots (but your income doesn't depend on it) at a fraction of the price, then this is THE lens for your Nikon camera.", "Very sturdy.", "The item works just as we needed to.

Unfortunately the one we got came without instructions so we have been experimenting to find the best way to get a fast excellent cup of coffee. We have several different coffee machines, so if grinding for the Moka Express, we use the largest espresso grind setting. The Hamilton beach coffee grinder has a minimum cup amount, which is 4 cups. Bear in mind that most coffee pots are using a 6 ounce cup as their standard. Since our Moka Express only makes 2 cups espresso style coffee,  we  found that adding coffee beans until the blade in the grinder is just covered with beans worked great. It's important to be sure that the inside grinding cup is in place and then turned clock wise to lock in place before putting outside clear plastic cover on and turning clock wise to lock in place. They  both need to be locked in place separately! This could be why some people claim that the grinder fails to work after a short time. If the inside cup is not locked in place the grinder will not work and if you try to force the outside clear plastic container you can damage the locking tabs. We discovered that using 2 measuring spoons of the ground beans (that come with the grinder) are perfect for the drinks we craft in our  Moka Express. In order to shorten the brewing time we decided to start with boiling water in the lower chamber. We were very happy to save the 5+ minutes of brewing time. If you are using the boiling water, then obviously you will need to use a pot holder to protect your hands while connecting the top and bottom of the pot.  We set our electric stovetop to 8 on heat indicator set the oven timer to 5 min. and proceed to heat and froth milk while coffee is brewing. Pour 1/2 coffee cup of froth and pour coffee over the milk froth. Hooray! coffee is wonderful. We use a medium roast  coffee. The actual brew time is only about 2 min. using this method. The brewed coffee is very robust with medium roast more so then a drip method. Our over all goal was not to waste coffee. We have a family that get's up at different times and makes a full pot, which then would get thrown down the sink as who wants a cup of coffee that's a hour old. This way we get the benefit of saving money and having a relatively quick cup of coffee, kind of like the K cup machines, but without the cost. The flavor of an espresso machine without the cost and the counter space. It's been a win win for us. We have a battery run frother, that makes great frothy drinks. We bought rechargeable batteries so we would always have fresh power. Sending thanks to other people who suggest not to wash the Moka Express with soap. We are thrilled with all the great advice that has literally saved us hundreds of dollars on experimenting on other pricy coffee making products. Thanks Amazon that we have access to to simple, great, affordable products.", "Some other reviewers have complained of short arm length.  I have short arms and it fits well.  If somebody had longer arms, sleeve length could be an issue. The front is cut generously, so that if you have a big belly (like me) your belt will still be covered.", "How do two Australian men end up lost on the mountainside in the Colorado Rockies? It all started with three little irresistible words \"I dare you!\" Joseph Hudson and Rob Thorton have shared a twenty-six year long friendship and many wild adventures most of which started out because Joseph can't resist a dare and Rob loves issuing the dares that result in all sorts of mayhem for his far too serious friend.\n\nTypically, Rob's dares are relatively harmless but this time, Joseph isn't so sure that Rob hasn't gone too far.  They're stuck on the side of a mountain and the helicopter isn't due to come pick them back up until tomorrow evening.  Freezing to death is a very real possibility and Rob seems to think the whole situation is hilarious.  The man even brought beer so once Joseph calms down a bit he realizes that Rob must have some sort of warped plan in mind - and he's right.  Rob plans for them to spend the night in a rescuers cabin where they could both unwind and he can tell Joseph the bad news.  Unfortunately there's a little problem with the snowboard compass and there's no telling where the cabin is or if they're even heading in the right direction.\n\nPark Ranger Anna McCarthy isn't amused by the know-it-all Aussies antics.  She overheard Rob mention to one of their many admirers in the lodge bar last night that he had plans for them to heli-jump onto Knife Ridge Chutes and spend the night in the Wolf Creek rescue cabin - and instinct tells her these men have more money than sense so she keeps an eye on them until it becomes obvious they need her expertise.  Anna fully intends to read them the riot act and hit them with a huge fine but once she's led them safely to the cabin it becomes impossible to deny her attraction to them - especially Joseph.  Rob's fun and carefree but something about Joseph calls to her.\n\nSafe from the frigid weather outside, Anna accepts Rob's dare and agrees to participate in a mnage with the two gorgeous Aussies.  Rob's more adventurous and has indulged in mnage encounters but Joseph feels that sex is personal and should mean something.  He's been interested in Anna since he first saw her back at the lodge and there's no way he can turn down the chance to make love to her.  What's confusing him is Rob's sudden serious demeanor - something is definitely up with his longtime best friend but he'll worry about that later - when he doesn't have a desirable woman willing to heat things up with him and his best mate.\n\nLexxie Cooper surprised me with the intensity of this story.  Sure, I expected a scorching mnage, sexy Australian men, an exciting setting and laugh out loud moments that only good friends can provide.  What I didn't anticipate was the raw emotion involved that touched me emotionally.  I laughed and cried and fell in love with each of these characters and their spirited natures.  Rob and Joseph share a special friendship that really speaks to readers and makes you long for that one person who can always challenge and push you into trying something new and exciting just for the heck of it.  Anna enters their lives at such a pivotal moment that I just wanted to hug her.  TRIPLE DARE is everything I'd expected and then some.  You'll definitely want to make sure to have some tissues handy - but then there's nothing better than laughter through the tears.\n\nOther RED HOT WINTER titles are:\nWINTER FIRE by Jess Dee\nand\nTRUE HEART by Delilah Devlin\n\nChrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)", "I love it!

In fact, there were a couple songs where I expected Ozzy Osbourne to start in with his banshee wailing.  To tell the truth, it would have been welcome given that the lead singer of Trouble is easily the weakest link.  However, there are long stretches of music in which he does no singing whatsoever.  It is during these stretches that this band shines the brightest.  They have a few moments where they sound like Doom Metal, but overall this is straight Heavy Metal with a serious case of Black Sabbath worship.  I don't mean to sound like I don't enjoy the album because it is good, except for the vocals.  All in all, this is a solid Heavy Metal album with some infectious guitar grooves and a worthy cover of Cream's \"Tales of Brave Ulysses.\"  Later.", "Quickly sharpens my German and American knives.\n\nI don't use it on my Shun knives because Japanese knives have a different edge angle.", "great song and quite catchy", "Never cared for a crunchy Anything so these are a deelite", "Prompt delievery, good quality and price", "Great gift for young kids!

While many of the songs are not what I would term \"artistic masterpieces\" (a few are), it is a very fun album to listen to, and ultimately, isn't that why we listen to music? I was thoroughly entertained by the album, and feel that it is laughable some believe this album marked a decline in Wonder's illustrious career.\n\nThere is a notion out there, that unless Stevie releases something which tops \"Songs in the Key of Life\", it is not innovative. I find that notion nonsensical. If \"Characters\" were to be released before \"Talking Book\", people would likely be lauding it as brilliant. I ask those who believe Stevie lost his zest and magical touch in the latter part of his career, what do you wish he would do in order to be on the cutting edge? Should he create a new instrument, or perhaps play in the key of life, instead of the key of C? I feel that if he produced his music the same as he did in the 70's, he would be accused of getting stale, so he adjusted to the 80's as he saw fit; I feel he did a first-class job in that transition.\n\nNow that I got my rant out of the way, lets move on to the album. Before I bought all of Wonder's albums, I had the 4 disc box set, \"At the Close of a Century\". I was always enthralled by the song \"You Will Know\", and feel that is on par with any of his previous work, it is truly an extraordinary song. \"With Each Beat Of My Heart\" is an underrated slow/mid tempo ballad; I thought it was great, and then Stevie played his harmonious Harmonica, taking it to the next level. It is followed by \"One of a Kind\", which contains another beautiful Harmonica solo. \"Skeletons\", \"Galaxy Paradise\", and \"My Eyes Don't Cry\" are other favorites of mine. The duet with Michael Jackson, \"Get It\", while good, was not something I particularly loved; I felt like it was an attempt just to capitalize on Jackson's popularity at the time. While the Jackson collaboration was decent at best, \"Come Let Me Make Your Love Come Down\", with  B.B. King & Stevie Ray Vaughan, was extremely well done.\n\nOverall, this album has a few songs that belong on a \"Best Of Stevie Wonder\" list, and many others that are catchy and enjoyable listens. In fact, I have quite a few of them stuck in my head as I write this review. I always felt a Stevie Wonder CD was a safe buy, and this one is no different. I cannot see how one can walk away from this album dissatisfied, especially if you enjoy Wonder's work. While this CD can sound quite \"poppy\" in spots, many songs have that distinct 80's sound, it clearly has Wonder's fingerprints (or tips), all over it, and lucky for us listeners, he is a musical genius.", "Great.

The Clash's masterpiece, right?  Not quite.  It's their second or third best album in my opinion, right behind the Clash's debut and Give 'Em Enough Rope.  Nothing and I mean *nothing* leaves me more excited and speechless like the Clash's debut.  I really don't know whether I like Londong Calling or Give 'Em Enough Rope more.  You have a ton of diversity with a few forgettable/overrated moments in London Calling, or leftover punk aggression but weaker songwriting with Give 'Em Enough Rope, so it's sort of a toss-up between the two.\n\nThe title song has gained fame in recent years.  I really don't remember any radio station playing this song when I embarrassingly became a regular FM listener 20 years ago (and I don't listen to the classic rock format on the radio anymore for obvious reasons).  A few other Clash songs from the 80's such as \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\" and \"Rock the Casbah\" would receive constant airplay but never this one.  What a shame.  A bouncy rhythm that's REALLY catchy, and wonderful vocals that make you feel like a group of young rebellious people are on an undercover mission to take over London during a typical rainy English setting, and yes my friends, take over it with a need to change the government they must!  \"Brand New Cadillac\" has an intro that reminds me of the part of \"Black Sabbath\" (the song from Black Sabbath's debut) when it speeds up near the end, however despite the similarity, the vocals are pretty catchy.  Not a favorite because it's essentialy a slightly heavier but very basic blues melody performed in a new wave-ish way, but it's decent.  \"Jimmy Jazz\" continues with the surprises as this is nothing like the more guitar heavy punk that I normally associate with the genre, and instead this is a steady-paced jazz and blues melody with little notable arrangements other than horns (that feel out of place by the way) and songwriting that's a bit weaker than even the less interesting moments from Give 'Em Enough Rope.  Well then again, nothing's weaker than \"Cheapskates\".  The horns really need to go at any rate.\n\n\"Hateful\" is an *excellent* song.  I can't stop singing the chorus \"Anything I want, he gives it to me-e-e, anything I want, he gives it but not for free\".  It's really an awesome melody and probably the best song on the entire album.  \"Rudie Can't Fail\" has a melody based around the Dixie Cups \"Iko Iko\" but with a bit of Clash diversity to set it apart... somewhat.  I love it all the same I admit, though I really don't know why.  It's catchy sure, but nothing extraordinary.  Only memorable by Clash standards.  The way the melody constantly repeats the \"Rudie Can't Fail\" line at the end is the best part.  \"Spanish Bombs\" is super catchy and another highlight, though the fact the song is based around the same melody for 3 minutes wears thin after a while.  \"The Right Profile\" has horns used in a more bearable way which is why I can't tolerate \"Jimmy Jazz\" very well, and in fact, the horns are actually melodic as the lead singer delivers a fantastic set of vocals and lyrics with the line \"And everybody says what's he like, everybody says is he alright, everybody says he sure looks funny\".\n\n\"Lost in the Supermarket\" (yes I get lost in there sometimes too, especially when I enter the dog food or paper towel aisle) has a hint of sadness and sincerity in the vocals which makes it pretty unique.  You can sing along to the vocal melody too which is a benefit.  \"Clampdown\" has a basic beat with forgettable vocal mumbling in the beginning, but quickly switching to a more upbeat though ultimately very ordinary vocal melody.  I don't really mind that it's ordinary perhaps because it sounds so refreshing for 1979 so I end up enjoying it all the same.  \"The Guns of Brixton\" is another really wonderful song because it sounds really original and just *cool*.  Listen to that rugged guitar tone.  The lyrics are cool too.  \"When they kick out your front door, how you gonna come, with your hands on your head or on the trigger of your gun?\"  I love that line and the David Bowie-like way it's sung.  \"Wrong 'Em Boyo\" sounds like a throwback to the glam rock days with an eerily similar vocal melody to Mott the Hoople but slightly jazzier.  Again, the horns should have been removed because they really don't enhance the already good enough melody, and I actually think the short vocal melody in the begining is better than what serves as the main one.  Small complaints.  \"Death Or Glory\" has lyrics that are rather difficult to make out, but at least the memorable chorus is easy to understand with the line \"Death or glory, becomes just another story!\"\n\n\"Koka Kola\" includes a flashback of sorts to that much beloved early punk sound that I hold dear.  Man I yearn for the Clash's debut all the time, even right now while listening to London Calling!  That's how much awesomeness it contains!  \"The Card Cheat\" is one of the more bizarre songs here.  The lyrics about serving the king gives the melody a majestic aura of elegance, but the verse melody feels dramatic in a \"And Then He Kiss Me\" by the Crystals kind of way.  An odd combination of two radically different styles, and the Clash deserves a ton of respect for that.  \"Lover's Rock\" reminds me of a place in Rehoboth Beach Delaware that my family refers to as \"Lover's Lane\" where all the teenagers make out by the water fountain near the bay.  Kind of creepy there's one spot for several teens to make out because that's supposed to be a private moment of intimacy, but the melody on this track is pretty groovy and somewhat ballad-like.  The way the melody sort of drifts into a dreamy state with piano and female vocals is unusually pleasant.  \"Four Horsemen\" carries a pretty good verse melody and I like the way the singer sings the line \"You're never gonna ride that lonely mile\".\n\n\"I'm Not Down\" is my favorite song on side four.  I don't normally acknowledge that the album is split between four sides, but in this rare exception I simply must because it stands out so darn much!  \"I've been beat up, I've been thrown out but I'm not down\".  Let THESE lyrics be the motivation you need to overcome a depressing period of your life (and hopefully such a period will never come because being depressed stinks).  \"Revolution Rules\" is based around a reggae beat with horns that not only do NOT annoy me, but actually feel appropriate and enhance the vocal work.  Over 5 minutes is a bit much and the Clash never really were consistently strong songwriters and it shows here.  \"Train In Vain\" is one of those songs I never paid much attention to by itself, but in the context of a double album it takes on a whole new meaning.  The vocal melody *is* pretty decent after all (I originally didn't think it was anything special).\n\nOverall, this is the album that people should hear if they want to find out what it's like when a punk/rock band tackles diversity and succeeds most of the time.  I actually think side one contains most of the weaker songs whereas sides 2, 3 and 4 remain strong.", "If you are looking for sound reduction you are looking in the wrong place.

He was here for Christmas break so I helped him set the printer up and he printed non-stop for 2 weeks and I had the opportunity to work with the printer closely during that time.\n\nThe features of this printer are quite impressive considering the price. It has a smallish build volume - 4.7\" x 4.7\" x 4.7\" - but larger models can be split up into pieces or sized down. And really, the recipient (a 16 year old) has not found the build volume to be especially limiting. It has a heated bed. It's quite compact for people who are short on space. This would likely fit in any dorm room. It also comes fully assembled and ready to print. This is especially nice for people who have zero experience with 3D printing. You can print via a microSD card, a USB cable connected to your computer or over wifi.\n\nThere is a 3.7\" color IPS screen on the front and the user interface is very friendly and easy to use.\n\nI am writing this review for people who are completely new to 3D printing so experienced users will likely want to skip this. First of all, 3D printing is about as hands-on, DIY as you can get. For example, every filament is different - even from the same manufacturer. There can be variances in diameter, variances in printing temps, etc. That will affect your prints. The settings in your slicer are also critical and tweaking those settings is a part of the process. Your print bed must be very level and on this printer, that is done manually. It will seem daunting at first but soon, you'll be able to do it in your sleep. The main thing to understand is that there is a constant learning curve. Especially with a budget printer. However, there is a vast community of 3D printing folks who are extremely helpful and have posted countless videos and blogs that are filled with helpful information. There is likely an answer out there for any issue you will encounter.\n\nThe included user guide is pretty good for setting this printer up the first time. It's also available at the Monoprice website for download. The printer ships with a plastic spatula for removing your prints, a tiny Allen wrench for leveling the print bed, the filament spool holder, the power adapter, a USB cable, and a microSD card that contains important files. More on that later.\n\nI suggest that if you purchase this printer, you order at least one spool of PLA or PLA+ filament because it only comes with a sample amount of filament. I have had great luck with Hatchbox brand. Be sure to order 1.75mm PLA. This printer will also print other kinds of filament but PLA is the easiest to print and is best for beginners, IMO. Also, I suggest buying some filament cutters like these&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hakko-CHP-170-Micro-Soft-Wire-Cutter-1-5mm-Stand-off-16-Gauge-Maximum-Cutting-Capacity/dp/B076M3ZHBV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hakko CHP-170 Micro Soft Wire Cutter, 1.5mm Stand-off, 16 Gauge Maximum Cutting Capacity</a>&nbsp;and some inexpensive calipers to check filament diameter&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/FineSource-Electronic-Digital-Caliper-Inch-Metric-Conversion-0-6-Inch-150-mm-Carbon-Fiber-Gauge-Micrometer-Extra-Large-LCD-Screen-Auto-Off-Featured-Measuring-Tool-Black/dp/B073N7F2CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">FineSource Electronic Digital Caliper Inch/Metric Conversion 0-6 Inch/150 mm Carbon Fiber Gauge Micrometer Extra Large LCD Screen Auto Off Featured Measuring Tool - Black</a>\n\nThe microSD card comes with the install files for Cura, free slicing software you install on your computer that allows you to adjust your printer settings and send the model to your printer, as well as monitor the printing process. It also comes with a model of a cat to print. The included sample of filament is enough to print this cat model. Cura will need to have certain values entered that are specific to this printer and that is covered in the manual however, there are updated Cura settings available for download from the Monoprice website.\n\nI suggest after ordering that you watch a number of the great YouTube videos that demonstrate how to set up and print with this printer. It will make it even easier to start printing right away when your printer arrives. You should also read on various 3D printing websites about the basics of 3D printing that are common to all filament printers and then pages that are specific to this printer. There are also many videos that cover the modification I suggest later in the review.\n\nI purchased a small, tool bag for my young friend to keep his tools and supplies handy. I added a box of gallon zip lock bags to store his filament in because PLA can absorb moisture from the air so should be stored in something air-tight. I also place my printers on a single, ceramic tile so that I am sure it's on a completely flat surface. A 12\" x 12\" tile or larger is plenty big enough for this printer. You can buy single tiles at Lowes or Home Depot.\n\nStraight out of the box, the first print was quite decent (and looked fantastic to some other friends who had never seen a 3D print) and we had no issues with printing at all. We tweaked the settings a little for the filament we used and the next print was even better. Again, 3D printing is a hands-on process. We immediately printed a replacement knob for the printer which is easier to turn and it looks great and fit perfectly.\n\nI do have a concern about the gantry, which the print head moves along. It is only attached on one side and I can see at some point that it could begin to sag, which would definitely affect printing. There are already a couple of modifications that require only simple, 3D printed parts and a metal rod and some linear bearings. The parts cost ~ $25. This mod is next on my list. Search \"MP Select Mini X Gantry Support + Camera Mount [Reinforced and Realigned] by svideo\" on Thingiverse for the 3D printed parts and links to the necessary hardware.\n\nI also added a piece of glass to the print bed because I'm used to printing on glass and it provides a mirror finish to the bottom of prints. Google and you will find a template someone made to cut the glass the correct size. I just used glass from a cheap, Dollar Store picture frame and a thermal mat to adhere it to the bed, but you can use small, bulldog clips instead.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/FBApayipa-400mm-x-210mm-x-0-5mm-Silicone-Thermal-Pad-for-CPU-GPU-Heatsink/dp/B01N9HGKR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">FBApayipa 400mm x 210mm x 0.5mm Silicone Thermal Pad for CPU GPU Heatsink</a>\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of models available for free on several websites.

However, it's wonderfully affordable and produces nice prints reliably.

But it took a long time -- two and a half years -- before they released a sequel to their surprise smash hit.\n\nAfter Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd's music began to change.  Roger Waters took over all lyric writing.  The music itself became less of a collaborative effort - Nick Mason stopped contributing, followed by Rick Wright and eventually David Gilmour.  The experimental edge that Floyd had in their early days was already fading fast, and disappeared completely by the late 1970s to be replaced by a more radio-friendly format.  And the group's sound began to change, with the gritty and rough sound present on Meddle and Dark Side becoming more slick and clean.\n\nThat transition was still in its early stages.  Waters's lyrics, while cynical at points, do not yet have the extreme bitterness present on ensuing albums; indeed, his tributes to Syd Barrett on \"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\" and \"Wish You Were Here\" show a side to his writing that would recede in a few years.\n\nBoth halves of \"Shine on\" -- the album's highlights, despite receiving less airplay than the middle 3 songs -- showcase the power of the Rick Wright/Roger Waters/David Gilmour team.  It would be the last time those three names would share composer credit, in my opinion to the detriment of the music.  Rick Wright's substantial contributions to Floyd's music were sharply curtailed after this album.  Musically each does his bit as well - Wright's keyboard playing, particularly in Part I and in Part IX, is among his finest with the band; Gilmour's biting, passionate guitar solos, are among those that created his reputation; and Waters's singing, which is more assertive and rich than on earlier albums but without the narrow emotional and tonal range of later work.\n\nThe other three songs provide a nice interlude.  The synth-heavy \"Welcome to the Machine\" and \"Have a Cigar\" rail against the musical industry, one grim and the other cynically humorous.  \"Wish You Were Here\", despite being interpreted by many as a love song, is really just a heartfelt tribute to their former colleague; the combination of Waters's lyrics and Gilmour's rough voice completely avoids the schmaltzy blandness of later live versions.\n\nHighly recommended.  Dark Side may or may not be better overall, but to this listener Wish You Were Here is the more meaningful album.", "Got bad breathe and want to freshen your mouth, well, ICE BREAKERS ICE CUBES will do that.

The first game in the series made a little bit of noise and had a cult following leading up to the release of the second game to the arcades. Who knew that history was being made as SF II gave birth to the fighting game genre and revolutionized video games at the same time. Everyone went crazy as soon as they played this game to death while mastering all of the characters' moves, combos & strategies; players were sharing what they knew or found out between each other. No other arcade game had such a deep and devoted following and created tournament style gaming like Street Fighter II. Then, Capcom shocked everyone by announcing a port of Street Fighter II was coming to the SNES and it was released in 1992. This port was revolutionary for its time because while Capcom made changes to the game, the core essence remained and it was still as fun to play as it was in the arcades.\n\nStreet Fighter II is a fighting game where you face off against the computer in a series of matches that lead up to the game's main villain, M. Bison. You choose from one of eight characters, face off against the other 7 characters, then you go up against 4 boss characters (including M. Bison.) Each character has his/her own storyline and ending so you find out their specific reasons for wanting to fight M. Bison. After every third match, you enter a bonus stage where you get to earn additional points before the timer runs out (there are 3 bonus stages in total.) The game features a 2 player vs. mode so you can take on another human player but you can only choose from the 8 characters and not the additional boss characters. Finally, there is an option screen where you can change the buttons on your controller, play audio tracks from the game and adjust the difficulty level of the game. As an added bonus, there's a code you can use where both players can use the same character in a match.\n\nThe PROS: This was revolutionary because they took an arcade game that was 58 megabits in size and shrunk it down into a 16 mega-bit cartridge. While changes were made, it looked and sounded close to what the arcade game was. On top of that, the controls were perfect. The game used every button on the SNES controller so Capcom did not have to compromise the button scheme at all. The rules of the arcade game were the same as the SNES port so you weren't missing out at all as far as how your character moves or what strategies to use against the computer or another human player. The same character code was such a sweet bonus as it was NOT featured in the Street Fighter II arcade game.\n\nThe CONS: Like I said before, this is not a perfect port. In order for the game to retain the same feel, Capcom had to make changes across the board for this game to fit and work properly. There are too many to list but it doesn't hurt the overall experience too much as there were people who never got the chance to play it in the arcades. For them, buying this game for the SNES was a perfect way to find out what the hype was all about. What is surprising is that when you put the difficulty level to its highest point, it is 100 times harder than the arcade game so only the most skilled SF players were able to defeat M. Bison at the highest difficulty level.\n\nIt was a great time to have the SNES as Capcom would release a port of Street Fighter II: Champion Edition for the Sega Genesis more than a year after Street Fighter II was released for the SNES. Not only did fighting games become popular, but the gap between the quality of arcade games and their ports to home consoles became smaller and it was starting to become common to see popular arcade games ported to SNES, Genesis, etc. If by chance, you have never played any of the earlier Street Fighter II games, you can either pick up a used SNES copy, look for the numerous Street Fighter anthology collections that are out there or download this title for the Wii via their Virtual Console service for 800 points (US $8.) I recommend you try it out if you haven't done so yet.", "Of whatever talents I have being a musician isn't up there near the top of the list. Dont get me wrong, I love music, have many musicians for friends and want so hard to be good enough that other people would actually want to listen to me. As my musician friends tell me  practice, practice, practice.\n\nAnd the best way to practice is to own an instrument. Of any instrument I play it seems my natural abilities lean more to percussion and I have gotten a lot of use and enjoyment from another Rockjam drum product. Okay maybe they're not concert quality but they're not a toy either. This set is surprisingly well made and the sound quality is even more surprising. Yes, the wood thats used is rough and barely finished and has a very homemade feeling to it. I love that compare to something slick and plasticky like you would find in a toy store.  To rough-hewn look seems to translate to the sound itself and gives it an earthy rustic sound.\n\nBongos, of all drum-related instruments, have always been one of my favorites to play and to listen to. The primary reason I got these is I like attending impromptu drum circles and now I can join in with my own bongos. Beside that did you know that playing the bongos can be very therapeutic, having the capacity to ease tension and lower blood pressure?\n\nA couple of things worth noting  Rockjam products are popular in England and are only recently being sold in the USA. While there are few reviews in the U.S. there are hundreds of them at British site.  The overseas site offers this set in two styles which are functionally similar but have different cosmetics. While they show the 2-color style here the pre-sale sample Im reviewing is 1-color and has different mechanics, for example the head clamps extend to a ring around the lower base, rather than on the sides of the drums. Hopefully the seller will straighten this out and ship the model pictured or change the picture when they ship retail orders.\n\nMy 5-star rating is not for high quality of material or attention to build quality, neither of which is great but for the overall rough-hewn aura and sound that neither a pro instrument nor a toy could simulate. In other words they are fun to play and fun to listen to.\n\nCAUTION: Not having anything to do with the actual product but worth mentioning  I don't know why but this particular brand seems to be the victim of more infected web search results than Ive ever seen.

This is Erskine's only novel set in one time period, her other books tend to involve two time periods.", "I knew it would take a great game to pull me away from Age of Mythology which I've been playing like an addict for over 6 months now.  This is the game I was waiting for.  As a veteran Player of both the Civilization series (and the far superior Alpha Centauri) and Age Of Empire series, the similarities to both series was immediately obvious.  It shoudln't come as any surprise since this game was built under the Microsoft banner (makers of the AOE series) but developed by former Civilization creators. The end result is a game so close to perfection you are forced to wonder why no one had though of it earlier.\nWhile the gameplay is real time, most of the interface concepts and strategy has been adopted from turn based strategy.  Basically combat plays like AOE, but city management plays like CIV.  It's the best of both worlds really. The depth of research, complex alliances combined with shrewd AI make this one of the deepest real-time strategy games ever made.  Probably the deepest.  The use of nukes, aircraft, and huge armies result in huge bloody battles that every real-time player looks for.\nOne of the best concepts taken from the turn based games is the way cities are the key to conquest.  Cities can be raided and completely taken over by hostile armies.  Cities determine the size and shape of national borders.  Operating outside of national borders causes your troops to suffer attrition damage if improperly equipped.  Therefore, real-time players used to \"rushing' will find they must adopt a whole new strategy.  Armies might be the key to conquest, but it's developement that will govern their success.\nThere are two basic modes to the single player game: quick battle and the campaign.  Players of the campaign will notice similarities to another hybrid type series: Total War.  There is a huge world map where armies can be moved around like game pieces.  After making your moves, the game goes into real time mode with objectives based on the decisions and moves you made previously.  Unlike Total War where the real time is strictly combat, the real time portion of the game also forces you to build resources and raise armies if necessary.  Exceptional victories are rewarded with game cards that can be played prior to going real time, another added bonus that gives depth to the game.\nWhile their are few real ground-breaking concepts in this game, by taking the best concepts of some of the greatest strategy games ever made is a bold leap forward.  Also, after playing Age of Mythology and Warcraft 3 with their beautiful 3D engines, the 2d graphics are a step back, but it's easily forgiven.  I've been playing this game for awhile now, and it seems like I learn somethign new every time I play.  Liek the best strategy games, there are a lot of layers and a lot of different paths to victory.  Any strategy game fan should pick this one up regardless of their preferences.", "This book provides very powerful insights into the Soviet system during the war at the time of the battle for Stalingrad. It is not easy reading especially because there are so many characters and it is extremely difficult to keep track of them given the complex Russian names. Nonetheless, it provides incredible insights into the Soviet systems, the persecution of their own people, their fears and, of course, the colossal fight for Stalingrad... a major turning point in the war. It is a long and difficult read but worthwhile.", "This bracing satire on Washington-style spin will have you laughing so hard you'll be struggling to keep up with David Mamet's typically quick-witted dialogue.  De Niro is great as spin master Conrad Brean, but Dustin Hoffman steals the show as Hollywood epic producer Stanley Moss: his greatest disappointment in life is that \"there is no Oscar for producing\", and he sees the virtual war he's engaged to produce as his final shot at recognition.  Historically associated with the White House's handling of the Lewinsky saga, \"Wag The Dog\" is just as relevant in the current political climate, perhaps more so: there are some sobering moments when the fatuous hubris cooked up to justify American foreign policy sounds remarkably, chillingly, familiar.", "Sturdy, just the right size for scooping muffins or pancake batter.", "I love it,", "Works just as you would expect with no problems.", "I love sci-fi, I am a Trekie and a Star Wars buff, so naturally I like this stuff.

I also checked to see if it would work on an older 550 model humidifier on another furnace and it was also perfect.

Thank you for such fast shipping.\n\nI found the installation instructions to be lacking, so I'll take it upon myself to revise them for future customers.\n\n1) Remove the 6 bumper bolts (not 4 like the instructions say.... they apparently forgot the 2 in the wheel wells). Unplug the driving lights. Remove the bumper and tow hooks.\n\n2)Remove lower front crossmember if equipped (?? I guess my Excursion must not be equipped?)\n\n3)Place receiver hitch inside bumper and line up outside holes.\n\n4)Using hitch as a template, mark and drill small pilot holes. Then, using a hole saw, cut holes larger than an inch.( Instead of bolting through the bumper, hitch, and frame..... just bolt the inside bolts through the hitch and frame. The inch + holes will allow the bumper bracket to fit right over the 1/2 inch bolts in the 'inside' holes.)\n\n5)Place hitch over the ends of the frame rails.\n\n6)Reinstall the tow hooks and lower crossmember (if so equipped). Now is the time to tighten the tow hooks because you will not be able to once the bolts are through the hitch.\n\n6a) At this time, install two 1/2 inch bolts through the inside holes in the hitch and frame. Install square washers and handle nuts and tighten with the hitch about a quarter of an inch from its highest possible position. On the drivers side, install the handle nuts from the top so they do not smash the A/C condenser when you tighten them. Pay close attention so the 'handles' do not crush / sever the wires for the block heater and driving lights. Torque bolts to 110 ft/lb\n\n6b) Wire tie the fog light wiring out of the way. the fog lights cannot be re-used with this hitch (though I may mount a pair of aftermarket lights and wire them to the factory wiring).\n\n6) Use a 1/2 inch drill bit to enlarge the bumper bolt holes on the outside of the frame because the outside hole on the hitch, and the holes on the frame only partially line up.\n\n7) Reinstall the bumper using the 6 bolts removed in step 1. You will see that the holes you cut in the bumper mounting bracket in step 4 will fit right over the bolts you installed in step 6a..... and should allow enough adjustment to end up with an acceptable gap between the top of the bumper and the bottom of the grill / directional. Properly torque bumper bolts.\n\nI gave this 4 star instead of 5 for the less than adequate instructions. The hitch itself is worthy of five. It fit well and I like that it is hidden behind the bumper. I intend to make a license plate bracket that will attach to the hitch receiver.

It's very long, easily twice as long as the stock barrel. Makes swing time longer in tight environments, plus it had a strange effect on the sound of each shot... quieter but more \"tinny\" sounding. Glad I got it, but it's a tool in the bag instead of a permanent attachment", "Corn nuts, enough said. They are about the same price on Amazon as they are at a gas station, which is to say a bit overpriced", "The Velvet Revolver album was a last stand for the rock scene and the folks who populated it from the late 80s all the way up to the early 00's. By the time Contraband came out, most of the groups that sold the gazillions of records from 88-2002 were in the waning stages of their careers, material-wise. GNR, Metallica, STP, Alice in Chains, Pantera, Soundgarden, Megadeth et al. were basically in the greatest hits phase of their respective careers.\n So when contraband came out in 2004, it was a nice coda to the excellent rock scene that had been evolving for the last 20 years.\n  I think the record is a fine sounding testament to the towns of those guys. With Scott Weiland fronting the group, and Slash, Duff, Matt Sorum and Dave Kushner, you get some of the finest players in the genre creating valid and new material.\n The Cd came out in '04 so I'm not really reviewing the album, but rather, I'm reviewing the reissue of the LP, specifically the \"MusicOnVinyl\" release that came out this year, in 2014.\n \"MusicOnVinyl\" is an EU company,  are therefore, imports, and various record labels license out particular album for them to remaster. They make an excellent product. I'm not a huge fan of the 180G records that come out now, because I find them to be rushed and somewhat inferior. However this particular company makes fine products.\n  On \"Contraband\" the music is very pleasurable to listen to. The equalization on their record is almost 2nd to none. Their records sound crisp n' clear AND you can hear the various parts of each composition quite clearly. Even the subtle pieces are easily audible. The packaging is excellent and sturdy.\n One thing I don't like is that the format required that every record has to be broken up into a double album. Which is a pain for people who listen to long players. Other than that, you will get a very very high-quality sound from the music on vinyl records with good solid low frequencies the bass and drums, you can hear all of the intricate guitar part that Slash, Matt and Duff and have woven together. I highly recommend the MusicOnVinyl version. They also make a great copy of Bush's 16 stone, Stone Temple Pilots \"Tiny Music\" and Alice in-Chains' great EP \"Jar of Flies\"-all available from MusicOnVinyl. Contraband was a great Record for its time, and sounds just as good in the \"new-old\" format of wax records.\n  P.S.-God I hate the term vinyl. It is such a \"hipster\" word. That is how these twentysomethings refer to LPs or wax records. And I'm only 35. But I never called a record\"vinyl\" growing up.", "Easy to install on my Honda RL", "Fits perfectly at the 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock position. Stiff at first but after a breakin period using an old panty hose and leaving the gun in it for a few days it loosens up just right. I use it for a Kimber Aegis 9mm.", "This game is fantastic. I mean, addicting. The premise is simple enough that most kids or teenagers can easily catch on and any adult will find it fun and interesting. If you haven't played any Ticket to Ride games, the premise is that you claim tracks between cities to complete various routes, while other players are doing the same thing for different routes.\n\nThe Europe edition is different from the debut US edition in that it: (1) uses a Europe map, obviously; (2) adds ferries, requiring one or two locomotive cards to cross water; (3) adds tunnels, meaning a section of track in mountainous areas could cost up to three extra train cards; and (4) adds train stations, which allow you to \"borrow\" someone else's track between two cities to complete a route. These changes are all for the better, I think. They make some tracks more challenging or more of a gamble to acquire, and they allow for a means to complete routes even if other players block one of your destination cities.\n\nThere are so many different strategies you can use and so much variation each time the game is played that it takes a long time for this game to get old. Each game lasts anywhere from 30-60 minutes, so it's not a huge time commitment, but is a lot of fun. One of the best games to come out in the past ten years. Strongly recommended!", "As a seventeen-year old piano student, I have always enjoyed Pollini's playing and thoroughly admired his technical and intellectual prowess. However, when one approaches the late Beethoven Sonatas, limiting an interpretation to these two factors will often leave the listener unsatisfied; one must also tap into the emotional realm. For example, the opening of Op. 110 is headed \"cantabile\" and \"expressivo\". Pollini plays the opening themes in such a straight-forward manner that if the listener weren't familiar with the piece, he would never suspect these markings. For me, Pollini is much more suited to the standard virtuoso repertoire (he plays pieces such as Stravinksy's Petrouchka or Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata phenomenally). For this reason, the Hammerklavier stands out as the highlight of this CD. Listening to him play the last movement of Op. 111 or either Arioso in the third movement of Op. 110 leaves me unmoved. Still, these recordings are legends in their own right, deservedly so. I do recommend them to any lover of the late Sonatas, but for a more enthralling experience, try Barenboim or Arrau. It simply isn't enough to just play the notes...", "I found out about this product from my MedSpa.

You have several character to choose from for marriage. Some are outgoing and easy to befriend, and other are shy and difficult. You really have to work hard to impress some!\nThere is still farming and mining, and the harvest sprites. But in this one you also have to collect musical notes. Most of them you find just by doing everyday chores. You can get notes for being outside, or being in the rain,... just about anything really! Once you collect so many notes, it becomes a musical instrument that (I hope) will eventually awaken the Harvest Goddess. I haven't actually beaten it yet.\nThere is a new aspect of choosing which plot of land to buy. There's a certain amount of strategy to it because one lot is very large but not very fertile, another is very fertile but not so big, and another is somewhat fertile with medium size.

The absolute care with which it was created is intoxicating.\nThis is one of the best.  Maybe THE.", "Since I've had Norton 360, I've avoided some nasty viruses and cast off many tracking cookies.

It's a brilliant adaptation of the Jane Austen classic and simply lovely to watch. Emma Thompson did an excellent job on the screenplay, and deservedly won an Oscar for her efforts.\nI agree that  in the age department, Emma Thompson was not suited to carry the role of  Elinor Dashwood (who's supposed to be only 19). However, Ms Thompson's  acting was brilliant and flawless, and as the story unfolds and draws you  in, you hardly remember to notice or care about the age factor anymore. I  thought Emma Thompson's portrayal of Elinor was not unlike the character of  Margaret Schlegel (which she played in \"Howards End\") who's also  a kind gentlewoman who loves too much and suffers inwardly.\nAs a story,  \"Sense and Sensibility\" (S&S) has a far more serious premise  compared to 2 other Austen works ie. \"Emma\" and \"Mansfield  Park\". Perhaps this partly explains why S&S is the more  highly-acclaimed movie (it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars)  compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's \"Emma\" and Frances O'Connor's  \"Manfield Park\". In S&S, there are very sad scenes involving  unrequited love, quiet suffering (Elinor's and Col. Brandon's) and long  illness (Marianne's). Many scenes will make you reach for that box of  tissues eg. when the always calm-and-collected Elinor burst into  uncontrollable tears the moment she hears the (happy) truth concerning  Edward Ferrar's situation, and when Marianne (still lying ill in her bed)  thanks Col. Brandon softly (for all his help and kindness).\nI also admire  Alan Rickman's acting. He is perfect as Col. Brandon, a very good man whose  love for Marianne is (sadly) unrequited. His love is of the best kind - he  doesn't court with (empty) flowery words, instead he displays so much care,  concern, lovingness and tenderness by his every look towards Marianne and  by his every action to make her well and happy. I was nicely surprised that  in the movie, Col. Brandon looks more dashing and handsome than John  Willoughby (to me anyway).\nKate Winslet's \"Marianne\" is  adorable as well. She sings beautifully and has such grace and beauty that  it's no wonder men fell in love with her at first sight.\nI shall not give  away the ending, of course. But for the benefit of any viewer who have not  read the novel but wish for a better and more satisfying understanding of  the final scene involving Marianne, just remember the following sentence  which I quote from the novel:\n\"Marianne could never love by  halves.\"", "This cover has lasted it's first year better than other covers we've had.

If you knead the dough for over 10 minutes, the motor on the mixer will get very hot.\nI like the 5-Quart bowl that comes on the Artisan more than the 4 1/2- Quart bowl on the Classic because the 5 qt. bowl has a handle and can fit the dough of a larger recipe.

Like why Silly Love Songs is so often cited as an example of Macca's post-Beatles \"mediocrity\". What is it? Is Paul's golden vocal on the instantly memorable tune, or the ingenious harmonies and countermelodies over it? Perhaps it's the polished production, with the strings and the brass and that phenomenal bass-line simply bursting out of the speakers. I've got it! It's because the lyrics are simultaneously heartfelt and so deliciously ironic that the critics missed the point by a mile! Or not. I don't know, and maybe I don't want to.\n\nAt any rate, 1976's At the Speed of Sound may be the only Wings album that was really a \"Wings\" album. Of course Mr. McCartney remains in the spotlight, but each and every Wingster handles lead vocal on at least one song (even Linda, whose Cook of the House is a riot!). More than that, both longtime sidekick Denny Laine and guitarist Jimmy McCulloch get a shot at a song of their own - and both make good. This newfound democracy was probably just Paul's way of uniting his band for a gargantuan world tour; but the funky pop of Denny's Time to Hide and Joe English's vocal on Macca's own Must Do Something About It remain highlights of the record.\n\nBut for all that it's still Paul's band, and he steals the show. He supplied Silly Love Songs, obviously, and the #3 smash Let `Em In (the kind of song you really oughtn't to like but do anyway). But he also wrote two bona-fide McCartney gems - Let `Em In's rip-roaring B-side (!) Beware My Love and Warm & Beautiful, a ballad that's exactly as its name implies - and a plethora of fine material for himself and his bandmates both. The upcoming stadium tour obviously directed the album's sound; although super-polished and confident in the studio, expertly embellished by touches of strings and brass, nearly every song is an arena-ready showcase. If the songs weren't improved in concert (and many were), they certainly didn't suffer.\n\nHey, the public knew what they were talking about at any rate - At the Speed of Sound went all the way to #1, stayed in the charts for almost a year, and augmented a record-breaking tour. Not bad for a little number the critics reviled as more McCartney \"mediocrity\", eh?\n\nNOTES FOR REMASTERED PAUL MCCARTNEY COLLECTION:\n\nThe extras are once again excellent, albeit a little out of place.

Tony Martin resembles two of my all-time favorite singers... John Sykes (lead vocals/guitars with Blue Murder), and the dwarf Ronnie James Dio.

When B-list pseudo-journalists prop themselves up by making fun of Amy's struggles, they occasionally throw in an actual snippet of the music, revealing that Amy deserves credit as a truly excellent singer. Sure she sounds a lot like classic soul divas such as Billie Holiday or Etta James. But she's much more than a mere imitator, showing the raw talent that adds attitude and understanding to her inherent technical abilities. That attitude and understanding can be heard in this album's biggest winners, like \"You Know I'm No Good,\" \"Back to Black,\" and the great Ashford & Simpson update \"Tears Dry on Their Own.\"\n\nBut while Amy is not the imitator some claim her to be, the musical backdrop of this album is definitely derivative, rarely straying from basic 60s Motown sounds (though at least the music here isn't the limp semi-R&B that's all most pop producers can come up with these days). This album is also quite undeveloped, with only half an hour of original material, propped up unsuccessfully with a horrendous second version of \"You Know I'm No Good\" that calls itself a \"remix\" but only turns up the bass and adds an unwelcome rap from the annoying Ghostface Killah (we can probably blame the record company for the anemic track listing). Regardless, Amy's talents as a singer and lyricist shine through, but unfortunately she appears to be gifted with that type of genius that comes with a streak of self-destruction.

But in many ways, I consider it superior to the game that inspired it.  It's fast and simple - no letter values, no score multipliers, and no waiting for your next turn.  Players simultaneously build their own set of crosswords using a pile of letters drawn at the start of the game.  If you don't like the way your crosswords are turning out, simply pull apart some of the words, and start again.  If you have some letters you can't use, throw them back in the community pile and take new ones.  The key to winning is speed and agility.  When one player uses up all of their letters, everyone has to take another letter from the community pile.  With all these letters flying around, you'll have to pull apart words and make new ones on the fly.\n\nSince the letters don't have a point value, the winner of the round is the first person to use all their letters once the community pile is gone.  Bananagrams is unique in that the more players you have, the faster the game goes.  A two player game has long rounds with very large crosswords, while a six player game has rounds lasting about five minutes.\n\nOverall, Bananagrams is a great Scrabble substitute.  In fact, everyone I've played with actually likes this game better than Scrabble.

They appeared at just about the same time that Rock 'n' Roll was getting underway. But they weren't rock 'n' roll. I know, I know, they're in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, but they don't really belong there. They're not Rhythm and Blues either. I know, they've topped the R&B charts too, many times. They don't fit doo wop, either. However the Platters had great appeal to people who liked R 'n' R, R&B and doo wop, for sure. No, The Platters were a stand-alone, one-of-a-kind vocal group. They were largely created and brilliantly maintained by Buck Ram, one of America's greatest song writers of the 20th century. OK, it's just my opinion and you don't have to take it seriously. You can think of the Platters as a R 'n' R group, if you like. In any case, The Platters presented brilliantly crafted pop music. The singing and arrangements were exquisite. The song writing was absolutely first rate. Some of the covers of classic songs were the best ever made. This is rock 'n' roll? Not in my opinion, and my favorite music genre is rock 'n' roll. The Platters were The Platters. Enough said. They didn't belong anywhere. They belonged everywhere.\n\nSome of the Platters music probably will last forever, or at least for a long, long time. \"Only You,\" \"The Great Pretender,\" \"You've Got The Magic Touch\" and \"My Prayer\" were enormous 50s hits and I still hear them on the radio now and then. Plus, they turned out all kinds of wonderful cover versions of old classic songs. Well, here's a CD that pretty well wraps things up, or is a good place to start depending on your perspective. It's not a complete anthology and you shouldn't expect it to be. The disc I own is printed by Mercury, and that's not the same as the company listed here. But it's the same cover and the same list of songs in the same order. I bought it in the 80s but it's still in print (albiet, by another company), and plenty of used copies are available in one form or another. The sound quality on my CD is excellent.

As widely accepted, the first (pre-psychedelic) 2/3 is absolutely stunning.  For my money, these clutch of early singles, from the riveting and monumental \"HOTRS\" to the exquisite pop of \"Help Me Girl\"  equal if not surpass the best early work of the Stones, The Who, Yardbirds, Zombies, Kinks, and other R&B influenced British Invasion bands.  Unfortunately, a deficient quantity of great early material (which is tied in with their virtually nonexistent songwriting ability) doomed The Animals to an early grave.\n\nBy Track 15 (\"When I Was Young\"), Eric Burdon had moved to the west coast, assembled a new band and commenced the obligatory attempt at psychedelic pop rock.  Though not quite disastarous, this material almost completely replaces the raw whiskey and cigarette grit of The Animals' early stuff with saccharine, cringe-inducing, and ultimately woefully dated odes to the hippy dippy love fest that was late-'60s San Francisco scene.  Again, this is not a total disaster, as \"Anything\" is suprisingly delicate and endearing and the baffling \"Sky Pilot\" manages to squeeze a bit of emotional grit and interesting fuzzy guitar out of inferior material.\n\nThe final track of the retrospective,the Eric Burdon and War hit \"Spill the Wine,\" though enjoyable, smacks of predatory marketing in an attempt to lure in those casual listeners who really only want this song, \"HOTRS\" and maybe 'We Gotta Get Out of This Place.\"\n\nIn short, then, 5 stars for the first 2/3 and maybe 2 stars for the last 1/3.", "Nice Brushes Great Variety.

It helped to diagnose 2 out of 3 catalytic converters.", "Prince of Persia begins and plays out with the titular character recounting the tale of how he acquired the infamous Dagger of Time, and unwittingly condemned an entire kingdom. It all started as Sharaban, a Persian king and the hero's father, invaded the land of a Maharajah. There was betrayal from within as the kingdom's own vizier opened the gates to make way for the Persian invasion. In exchange, the vizier was promised his choice of the Maharajah's treasures, among which were the \"Hourglass of Time\", the \"Dagger of Time\", and the \"Pearl of Time\". During the invasion, the Prince aims to please his father by securing one of the legendary treasures himself from the treasure vault.\n\nThus is the stage set for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. Players must combine their own resourcefulness with the Prince's athleticism and skill in combat to make their way through the Kingdom of Azad, and eventually confront the Vizier for his treachery. Along the way, the Prince meets up with Farah, the Maharajah's daughter, and the two must work together to stave off the attacks of the sand creatures, and create their own path through the ruined palace. The journey will be laden with difficulty as the Prince must jump from one platform to another, scale ladders and pillars, swing from poles and ropes, dodge rotating blades and moving columns of spikes. At times he will even defy the laws of physics by literally running along walls, and repel from them to reach an opposing location.\n\nOnce the player has gotten used to the basic mechanics of the game, it becomes a matter of figuring out which combination of actions will allow them to advance. There may be a locked gate on the ground floor of a vast multi-level room, and the switch to open it is high on some balcony. Of course there will be no staircase or gondola to take you there, and so the Prince will have to make use of his skills and the environment to reach it. There are various puzzles as well, of the traditional block pushing and plate-stepping variety, but all of which seem logical within the context of the game.\n\nThe entire adventure takes place in the various parts of the palace of Azad, from the reception room to great halls, from the Sultan's personal zoo to the depths of the dungeon. The environments are spacious and meticulously designed, and so diverse that it seems hard to believe they're all part of the same castle. There is considerable attention to detail, from reflections in water to the cracks in aging concrete structures. The character models are designed economically, using lower poly counts than some of the other graphical powerhouse games out there, but probably as a compromise for the vast environments. Still they are more than adequate within the gestalt of the game's visuals, and are not likely to draw many complaints.\n\nIn conclusion, Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a quick adventure; With its simple control scheme, intuitive and fast-paced battles, there is little to stop most players completing it in around ten hours. With gameplay reminiscent of Sony's ICO, only with a more in-depth combat system, it should fit well into the collections of platform and action-adventure gamers alike.", "Exclusive: Senator Roger Wicker Doubles Down in Criticism of Colleague Bob Corker\nSenator Roger Wicker (R-MS)  doubled down in  his  criticism of reckless comments made by  his  Senate colleague  Senator Bob Corker (R-TN)  who renewed  his  attacks on President Trump Tuesday morning.\n\u201cWhen you have the kind of issue we\u2019re dealing with in North Korea where we have a very unstable leader there  when you send out tweets into the region to raise tensions  when you kneecap your Secretary of State whose diplomacy you have to depend upon  when you kneecap that effort  you really move our country into a binary choice which could lead to a world war \u201d  Corker  said.\n Corker  followed these attacks on the President on CNN  where  he  said \u201cThe debasement of our nation is what  he \u2019ll [President Trump] be remembered most for.\u201d\nAround the same time  President Trump blasted  Corker  on Twitter for opposing tax reform  saying that  Corker  \u201ccouldn\u2019t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee.\u201d\nAppearing on CNN shortly after  Corker \u2019s comments  Wicker was asked about Senator Corker  \u201cwho called the president an utterly untruthful president \u201d the host said.", "Sharpens very fast great and seams to be lasting would buy this tool again.

The video shows paint-removal with it... I can't contest that it has this capability, but given that it's about 1cm wide, can you imagine cleaning a whole window sash with this?

Used briefly, it removed rust down to bare metal from mild steel.\n\nDownrated one star because the product page didn't clarify what exactly it would do to various surfaces.

A family friendly feature that entertains from opening shot to the final fencing showdown (the longest ever done I believe).

Fundamentalist Christians are guilty of the former; fundamentalist Jews and Muslums are guilty of the latter. But Armstrong doesn't point fingers at these fundamentalists and say, \"Bad, bad people!\" Rather, she looks at the struggles each of the societies she writes about undergoes to modernize, and how each religion adapted, in some people, by turning to fundamentalism. She astutely points out the secularists don't have all the answers, either; all logos and no mythos makes Jack and Jill disillusioned children. Which, of course, leaves them open to fundamentalism, rather than a more balanced approach that leaves reason to reason and mystery to mystery.\n\nOverall, this is a well-researched and well-balanced book. I especially enjoyed the history of Iran leading up to the Iran hostage crisis (which itself gets little ink, as though it were anti-climatic; apparently it turned out to be a much greater venture than the students who took the hostages bargained for!). Some fundamentalists, especially fundamentalist Christians might not like the way they get portrayed; the televangelist scandals of the late 1980s are told a little tongue in cheek.

Luckily we have an outdoor faucet close by that we can use.

I really love the series and Lucas Davenport is a great cop/character.  A good cop, independently wealthy, he drives a Porsche, on the job, a smart investigator and a snappy dressing, ladies man.  Speaking of which, Davenport is still with Dr. Weather Karkinnen, but does some touchy-feely with prey, Sara Jensen and has eyes for gorgeous news lady, Jan Reed. He keeps busy.  The bad guy here is Koop and we meet him right off into the book.  This is one bad, messy killer, and a careful stalker.  Davenport is assigned to a serial case helping, terminally ill state investigator, Meagan Connell who is fixated on capturing the killer, by Chief Rosie Marie Roux.  I like the chief, political ambitions, yes, but she lets her detectives do there job.  Refreshing.  The book and all the Prey series are smart and well written.  I always recommend reading series in order, but if you can't, Sandford does a good job with background and descriptive information.

The subject matter sounds weighty but it is never dull.  Elements of a mystery are part of this story of the spinster English school teacher Miss Jula Garnet who is changed forever by her stay in Venice and the people she meets there.

It spans the time period from the Middle Ages to modern times.\n\nThis world is all in all pretty plausible.  The Islamic world essentially fills the vaccuum left by the destruction of Europe and competes with China, India, and to a lesser extent those we call American Indians.  To tie events together over such a long time, Robinson uses an interesting tool.  He assumes reincarnation exists and has a group of souls come back to Earth over time as various key players.  While this mechanism is not perfect, it is more often than not useful in binding together what a somewhat unrelated short stories.\n\nThat all said, I agree with Michael Clawson's critique.  My understanding is that the loss of population from the Plague was a key spark in causing the social and technological advances in Europe.  Mr. Robinson has this alternate world advance at nearly the same pace technologically and only moderately slower socially.  Doesnt make a whole lot of sense to me.  Where is the incentive for China to make more efficient tools when theres a huge surplus of people?  And why would India become a relatively free society when the status quo hasn't been changed much?  I think there could be decent explanations for this.  Unfortunately, Robinson doesnt really delve into them much.\n\nOne of the nice things about alternate history is that you can see the importance of a given factor if it is removed.  This book doesnt take advantage of that very well.  This alternate world seems to follow our timeline too closely.  There are major technological advances in the Middle Ages in Afghanistan simmilar to those in our Europe of the same time.  The Chinese and Arabs colonize the Americas at about the same time period as Europe did in our world.  There is an epic Moslem/China war set at about the time of our World War I.  It even has trench warfare!  So Mr. Robinson seems to be telling us (I believe unintentionally) that Europe doesnt really matter!  Im not buying that.  Not at all.\n\nOne final (and minor) critique.  The author hints at there having been a residual European culture.  I think it would have been helpful if Robinson threw his reincarnating characters into Plague ridden Europe.  Perhaps they could have been in a nomadic grouping in France searching for safety or a small village in Northern Scotland that managed to survive.  As best as I can tell the only Europeans Robinson identifies are what appears to be a caveman in Hungary in the very beginning and references to a \"nature preserve\" on an English island in the 20th Century.  Showing what happened in Europe could have added depth to this story.  Not a big problem though.  I just would have like to have seen it.\n\nThis is pretty good alternate history.  Not good enough that I would likely reread the book.  But I'll certainly come back and skim certain portions!", "Perfect for keeping a soccer ball at your preferred psi.

Past then, though, I own and have beat every single one.  My first Zelda was Link's Awakening, a magical game that everyone should play.  While that game is slightly more fufilling, in sheer gameplay you can't touch Oracle of Ages.\nThis time around, a Zelda game finally has a truly good plotline. The best script since Ocarina of Time, Oracle of Ages fools you, surprises you and offers more characters than ever before.  There is also some great plot twists you won't be expecting.\nBut everyone knows a story does not make a great game, correct? Fear not.  Instead of focusing on brainless swordplay like its companion, Ages' true challenge comes from its mind-bending puzzles.  Believe me, I was ready to conquer this game by myself and even I came crying to an internet strategy guide a couple of times throughout.  The emphasis on puzzles is especially apparent in the huge (and wonderfully thought-out) bosses.  Beating them is more like a good jigsaw than a battle area, yet still offering a little bit of both.\nThe premise of the game is practically identical to A Link to the Past for the Super NES - You'll travel between two worlds, one bright and lovely, one dark and mysterious.  The game makes use of this feature wonderfully, and your time-warping Harp of Ages gets upgraded along the way, soon adding an almost insane level of non-linear gameplay.\nComparing it to Seasons - the game is better in respect to satisfaction overall. The items, found in the complex, wonderful dungeons, are great, although not nearly as good as some of Season's showstoppers.  Oracle of Ages is much more exciting if you've already beat Seasons and using the password found in that game - there's so much more to do.  Aside from more cutscenes, bosses and one insanely hard dungeon, you'll get new items given to you through the form of passwords that must be told to  certain figures in the pak you played first.\nOverall, these games are tributes to the end of the Game Boy Color era.

I felt like I had to stop and breathe every now and then; the plot twists, suspense, surprises, and sheer horror of the plot had me so mesmerized, I almost forgot to do so!\nLike other Patterson novels, this one, the third in the Alex Cross series, features two parallel horrors, both of which involve the detective in a very personal way. First, a crazed killer is murdering young black children in Cross's own neighborhood, children from his own son's school. The sheer brutality of the murders bespeaks a rage that strikes terror in Cross's heart. But the Washington, D.C. powers that be don't seem to be overly concerned with the horrible happenings in the black neighborhood--they're much more involved with the high-profile, equally mysterious Jack and Jill murders that have captured all the headlines.\nJack and Jill are assassins. We're in on their nefarious doings from the beginning, but we don't know who they really are. And neither does the FBI, the CIA, the Secret Service, or the police. They are on a murderous timetable, assassinating increasingly well-known people as part of a single-minded, and seemingly unstoppable, track that leads to the assassination of the President of the United States. Can Cross et al. catch these fiends in time? And what of the child killer? He's got Cross's own children in his crosshairs. Will he strike at Cross's very heart and soul?\nThe sheer humanity and decency of Alex Cross--his intelligence, his love of his family and friends, the piano he plays on the porch to soothe his soul, the grief he still feels for his dead wife--all serve as a counterpoint to the inhumanity of the killers. Cross despairs of the human race as he encounters the horribly murdered bodies of the killers--but any world with Alex Cross in it can't be all bad. Cross sardonically refers to himself as \"The Dragon Killer,\" and indeed he is. But this time, he just may be up against a force more evil than anything or anyone he has ever encountered before.\nAs I stated in a previous review, I am new to the Patterson bandwagon, and now I have no intention of getting off!

They're hard to compare because of the way the band evolved over the years and they all have at least one weak track that has to be taken into account and compared to the better songs. After much listening, however, I've decided that 1996's \"Signify\" is their highest achievement. Out of all their releases, it works the best as a singular piece of work, that is, an album rather than a collection of songs. I don't own it on vinyl, but I bet it's got one of those sicknasty gatefold sleeves that were big in the 70's.\n\nThis music exists in its own world, a trait it has in common with classic albums by Pink Floyd and Radiohead. The production invokes images of a place that's mostly black void, with objects and scenes forming and dissolving into and out of the darkness. A nightmare world, perhaps. There's certainly enough creepy to go around for it to be one. There is a handful of relativel conventional songs on the album (\"Sleep of No Dreaming\" and \"Every Home Is Wired\" come to mind), but much of \"Signify\" is devoted to soundscapes that, while not entirely abstract, aren't exactly grounded in reality either. These songs are fascinating because they take elements from 90's techno/electronic music and give them a progtastic modification by using rock instruments like electric guitar, organ and live drums. \"Idiot Prayer\", for example, is pretty much one-of-a-kind, with its angry, sharp guitars and oddly dance floor-friendly bass line. There are samples of a man who seems to be trying to describe a DMT trip. He has a short monologue at one point, and one snippet of him saying \"Please help\" that repeats throughout the frantic parts.\n\nMy favorite track here is \"Sever\", a song that I suspect is meant to be what insanity sounds like. There's a flock of garbled voices in the mix, which to me suggests that the narrator is schizophrenic. I've read the lyrics, and they don't appear to have a discernible meaning, at least not to anyone other than the narrator. Perhaps you've met someone like this, whose mental illness causes confusion in their thoughts and words. They're speaking almost nonsensically, but you think that there might be some kind of message they have that they can't articulate. A similar thing may happen to a person who's taken a large dose of a hallucinogen. Even the song's vocal melody has a not-quite-right feel to it. I find it hard to decide exactly what emotion it's conveying. Fear? Anxiety? A kind of demented exuberance? Sadness? It's really hard to tell.\n\nListen to this album in the dark.", "vanity Fair has always been a fine product.  This one is excellent.

Soon, all the tool companies were putting out one inch wide blade tape measures, so Stanley upped the ante with bigger and wider tape measures with their \"Fat Max\" line.\n\nThe \"Fat Max\" has an inch and a quarter wide blade making the tape measure case thicker and a bit harder to grasp and hold. The blade extends farther without support, which some may find important, but the real advantage of the wider blade is it is easier to read. They make the \"Fat Max\" in 16, 25, 30, 35, and even 40 foot lengths, but that's got to be a very large tape measure that's awkward to hold and use, but if you need one that length they are available.\n\nThe \"inside measurement\" of the \"Fat Max\" 25 foot tape measure is 3 1/8 inch, which means the body of the tape measure is 3 1/8 inch long so if you butt the hook of the tape into a wall and then butt the back of the tape measure's body into the opposite wall, you have to add 3 1/8 inches to the measurement you read on the exposed blade. Many tape users will bend the tape blade into a corner to avoid having to butt the body of the tape into a wall or other inside corner, but with the wider blade tapes it is not as easy to bend the blades to get an accurate measurement so you'll likely want to add 3 1/8 inch to your inside measurements.\n\nTape measures like the \"Fat Max\" need to use powerful blade return springs, so the longer the tape measure blade the stronger the return spring has to be. Be careful when retracting the blade and either slow the blade down with the pad of your index finger -- gently contacting the bottom of the returning blade, or use the tape measure's \"blade lock\" to slow down the speeding blade from slapping home hard into the tape measure case. Control and slow down the returning blade and the tape measure should last a long time. You'll soon get a callous on your finger where you slow down the tape measure blade and eventually you'll automatically control the blade's return speed without thinking about it.\n\nThere's a reason that tape measures over a certain length used to have a reel that you cranked by hand to retract the blade and that design of \"reel tape measure\"still might be the best for long measurements since they use a hand crank that doesn't need a powerful blade return spring so there's less that can break and go wrong.\n\nIt is also worth noting that for around the price of a \"Fat Max\" tape measure, today you can purchase an inexpensive \"laser distance measure\" that are typically very accurate and rely on laser beams to measure distances much longer than tape measures can extend without worrying about the blade sagging or other things which compound inaccuracies. If you just need to take measurements, in many situations it might be easier and more efficient to use a laser distance measuring device. Laser measurer's don't work well in bright light, and neither are they good following grades or changes in elevation. Be sure to read the product reviews before considering choosing a laser measuring device to ensure someone is successfully using that type of device for your intended use.\n\nReviewers are claiming that the newer \"Fat Max\" tape measures are not as well made or as robustly designed as the old ones, and this might be true. When you get your new tape measure extend the blade fully and check that the markings are all correct and that none are missing or misprinted on the blade, and then check that the blade return spring is fully functional and will retract the blade without stopping or needing help. With long extended blades sometimes you need to give the tape a quick flip as though you were flicking a whip, and that often brings the blade return spring back into action. If the numbers are off, or the blade won't retract smoothly and completely, return the tape measure for another one.\n\nWhen working with someone else using a tape measure, place both tape measures side by side with the blades extended to ensure that the markings line up. Even tape measures from the same manufacturer can sometimes show discrepancies in blade markings.\n\nAnd, along with your new tape measure, consider adding a wood folding rule, such as the one's made by \"Lufkin\" the \"Red End\" wood folding rules in six foot and eight foot lengths (those with an extending six inch brass insert in the blade can take accurate inside measurements), the eight footers being the right length for measuring door height openings. For some types of measurement and layout, especially for close exacting work, a folding wood rule will provide the most accurate results; the old timer's knew this and now you do too.", "I never play this CD...It's too good.

On the other hand, in FreeSpace I was diddling along and then something shot me from behind and there was a big jerk on the stick that, added with the sound and screen, gave me the distinctive feeling that I'd just been blasted.  It was quite something!  One thing about this joystick that surprised and delighted me is that there's a CD packed with it that has FreeSpace Colossus.

It was great to see how they all fit back together, and how Robin crafted details from the first series into this one. She is an excellent storyteller, and made this trilogy as much a pleasure to read as the first.", "1967. Motown. Aretha. Stax. Soul was defined by very specific and regional sounds 'round this time. Motown had the pounding backbeat with the crisp hi-hat, bright guitars and pleading vocals. Aretha had the driving piano, tight drums and that ring-shout call-and-response with the backup singers. The Stax sound was the fat bass, crackling guitar licks, drums that snapped your spine and the performers sweat dripping from the speakers. That's what soul music was on the face of it in 1967. And then came Jerry Butler. Actually he was already here. For years in fact; starting with one of the century's greatest songwriters, Curtis Mayfield in the first incarnation of the legendary Impressions. The hits came. For Your Precious Love. He Will Break Your Heart. And as these things go, Jerry left. Went solo. The hits still came, but fewer and further between. Moon River. Let It Be Me. Then...the hits dried up. Motown, Stax and Aretha owned the airwaves. And Jerry became the first to do what others would later do in droves. In 1967, Jerry Butler went to Philadelphia to record. I can remember my mother unwrapping the the Mercury album by Jerry -\"The Iceman Cometh\". It came with a \"suitable for framing \" photo of \"The Iceman\" half-imbedded in a block of ice but looking as cool as a cucumber. Then she played the record on our first \"stereo\". We'd had record players before...but this...THIS was a stereo. My mother of course loved it. I however...was sent into another zone. To the right of me, I could hear the drums, bass and piano. To the left of me I heard the guitars, strings and horns. And dead center baby, was the mellow baritone of the god-damned Iceman! Whooooo! Soul music never sounded like this before. It was perfectly and pristinely recorded. You could hear every instrument AND Jerry Butler. It changed the way I listened to music forever. I was learning what an arrangement was, courtesy of Mr. Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, Thom Bell, the producers and arrangers of this album and of course...The Iceman. This compilation covers those years Jerry spent at Mercury records but even more importantly covers the period when soul \"grew up\". Gone from these recordings was the intentionally tinny, AM-friendly Motown sound and the brusque, transistor-fueled thump of Stax and Aretha. This was \"cool\" soul. As ready for the cocktail party as it was the jukebox. Gamble, Huff and Bell ushered soul into this new era with these recordings with Butler. It was the true birth of the \"Philly\" sound that would later dominate pop music for the better part of a decade. And it gave us the SECOND great \"album\" of the soul era after Aretha's \"I Never Loved a Man\", Jerry's \"The Iceman Cometh\". Unlike most albums at the time, this one was not \"one hit and ten pieces of filler\". Like Aretha's, this one boasted cut after cut of prime soul. Not a throwaway in the bunch-and it wasn't even a \"concept\" album! Fortunately this compilation includes that album and it's \"Ice on Ice\" follow-up. Listen for the sheer soul perfection of Jerry's aching (and occasionally emotively breaking) voice on \"Hey Western Union Man\" and \"Only The Strong Survive\" and then flip your 'fro to the almost symphonic, but soulful and little-heard gems, \"Lost\" and \"Are You Happy\". Remember what soul music sounded like before these songs came out...and then think of what soul became AFTER they hit!", "From the illustration, it appears that the ends of the wire would scratch the desk, etc., BUT rubber tips are included which fit well and stay on.

Here is my review for Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2 The Sith Lords. If you played the 1st game you will understand some of my refferences to past characters, if not I will still explain it anyways. I will also be makeing tons of refferences to the 1st game because I can explain how it's better or worst than the first game, So please enjoy my review! :)\n\nPlot (minor spoilers only) Set 5 years after the 1st game ends and 4000 years before the Phantom Menace, Now the sith are ruled by no one. They are all in chaos, everyone is still recovering from the final battle of the 1st game. You are a (jedi guardian or sentinel or a councoler because you can choose what kind of jedi you are from the start) who is on the Ebon Hawk from the 1st game drifting in space after a massive attack. In the prologue (if you wish to choose to play) you control T3M4 (who also returns from the 1st game) an astromech droid like R2D2 cept he is flat headded instead of round. You fix up the ship and heal your made up character then take the ship to the mineing planet of  Peragus II. When you get to the planet you are in the med bay getting healed. When you start playing you find out that you, a scoundral and a old jedi master are the only ones alive on the whole planet. You find out that sith attacked the planet along with some other evil dooers and a sith lord. After you get off the planet you can start your adventure of destorying the sith and the sith lord who is trying to kill you and try to reunite the jedi or go full dark side and kill everyone and everything in your path.\n\nCharacters: (down below)\n\nMain Character: You are known as the Exiled because the jedi kicked out of the order, why? You will need to play to find out. Anyways you can be a boy or a girl its an RPG so it lets you choose. At the begining you can choose to be a Jedi Guardian (aka the blue light jedi) who is a soilder who does more hand to hand or lightsaber to lightsaber combat. Or a Jedi Sentinel (aka the yellow lightsaber jedi) who relies on skill's and is a mediate between full combat and force useing combat. Or last you could be a Jedi Consular (the green saber jedi) who focus more on force powers to fight when in combat rather than fighting hand to hand combat. Because of the RPG of this game with interactions in the game you can choose to be either light side or dark side. Depending on how you play being either good or bad, the story can chage due to your side indiactor.\n\nKreia: is your jedi master. She is the 1st character you meet outside of the prologue. She is blind (litterly her eyes are all silver because she is blind. She is sorta a cranky jedi at times because when you become her student she wants to learn her way, to make everything and everyone you see as a tool for your advantage, that even means if stepping on your friends and them hateing you gets you further in life then take all advantage. She is jedi consular so she focus's more on force power fight but she can still fight with a light saber even tho she is blind. Because she is your jedi teacher she is pretty much the Bastila Shan of the 2nd game. Except in this game she really does teach you right from wrong because for example if you make a choice in the game she doesn't like or one she does like then she will break in mid conversation to either praise or scould you for you choice. Once this happens if she is your 3 man party if you continue to make the wrong soical choice of her liking she lose influcense in you and some questions will be harder for her to answer. (Influence will be explained later on down below) . Side chatting with her is fun at times because if you play your cards right you can increase your force points and your influences. Also she teaches you more force powers and so much more.\n\nAtton Rand: is a smuggler who has kind of at attitude problems at times. He is a shooter so he can fight with blasters better. He was once a republic soilder then turned side to the sith then quit the sith to do this own thing, so he is the lone wolf to say the least. Side chatting with him you can lean his past if you have his influence high enough. If you do you can train him to be a jedi so you can have another jedi in your party to fight with you. He takes over the place of Carth Onasi from the 1st game. He is the pilot of the Ebon Hawk. His own special in the game is his feeling which I mean is that when he says the famous line \"I've got a bad feeling about this\" this means there is going to be some action/fighting up ahead so he is like a mini sensor for trouble.\n\nT3M4: he is the astromech droid who returns from the 1st game. In this sequal game he is seriously upgraded in everyway, the programmers put in subtitles so you can understand every beep and boop he says unlike the 1st game where its litterly just says \"beep boop\" for every answer he has. Side chatting with him has also improved as well, you can talk to find out about what happened and sometimes he will make refferences from the 1st game. If you can get the influences high enough and if you have the repair skill to repair him enough he will show holograms of either Bastila or Carth talking about the Main Character in the 1st game and what happened after the final battle of the first game. T3 is really good at computers, repair, security and everything else that has to due with the intellegence skill. His special skill is being a work bench which means if he is in your party and you talk to him you can use him to upgrade all your weapons and armor that you have collected over the game. He can also make security spikes but won't after you have more than 10.\n\nBao-Dur: he is a technician who can repair all types of droids, he is accompanied by his tiny robot companion Remote who is a tiny floating orb who can repair droids if he is in your party with another droid present. Side talking with him is sort of boring, once you meet him you can pretty much go threw all of the dialouge choices very quickly. If you get his influence high enough he will ask you to train him in the way of the force to become a jedi guardian. Most of the time I left him alone because 99% of the time he is irrelevant as a playing character.\n\nGo-To: pronouced go toe. He is a droid who is run by a man called Go-To. He is a crime lord who is trying to save the republic with the help of the exile (aka YOU) . Being a droid companion his special abilities are a self clokeing device which mean he can go invisable if he chooses, and he has a special droid attack which in only present of enemy droids will make them turn on eachother and have them fight eachother so you can save your time and energy. Side chatting with him is intresting to say the least, if you get your influences high enough you can find out about his past and how he became a crime lord and all. If you finnish certin planet missions he will give you 2000 credits per planet for either stablizing them or destablizing them.\n\nHK-47: returning from the 1st game. He is the 2004 character of the year because of his personality, his use of insults of anyone who is not his current master, and his all around psychness. He is an assassin droid who when you first meet in the game he is broken and you must repair him. Once you do you can have all of his wickedness around you. Side chatting with him is fun, you can talk about destroying stuff and how to make enemies suffer. If you get influences high enough you can talk to him about his past where he makes refferences to Bastila and or Carth. Also in influence talking he can tell you on how to defeat jedi better with tactics that you wouldn't normally use to think of.\n\nMandalore: returning from the 1st game also. In the 1st game he went by the name Canderous Ordo who is a rough and tough Mandalorian. He is good at shooting or hand to hand combat. After the final battle in the 1st game he goes his seprate ways to reunite his clan. When you get him in your party he is really good at fighting. His special ability is haveing 4 seprate implants to make fighting better. He has regeneration so he can gain more health back quickly. A health booster so he has more health before hand. A strength booster to make him stronger in hand to hand combat and last he has a dexterity booster which can give his shooting ability a boost. Side chatting his him is alright. He doesn't have any special influence you need to worry about, everything comes out in normal conversation.\n\nVisas Marr: She is a Miriluka which mean she is blind from birth but can see threw the force. Because she is force sensitive she is a jedi. Her planet is Katarr which was destroyed by her master Darth Nihilus. She is first met when she tries to kill you but defeating her causes her lightsaber to break and then she swears her loyalty to you. Her special skills are stealth so she can sneek around well. Along with her jedi powers she is a deicent fighter but I wouldn't put her in the front lines for a perfect offense. Side chatting with her will reveal that if your influences with her are high enough she can teach you force sight which mean you can see how she see. Her force sight ability has the power to show you the inner esscence of people, which mean you can be talking to people and if you use this power they could turn blue for lightside, red for darkside, or gray for netural and droids are 100% netural even if they have a good or evil tinge to them they show as netural.\n\nMira: She is a bounty hunter. You can only get her in your party if you are good aka blue side aka lightside at the end of one of the levels. If you are good and she joins you, she will be of great help. Her special ability is when she is leader of the 3 person party she can walk threw landmines and NOT set them off. She is the only one who can use her special wrist rocket launcher which can fire rockets and grnades. She is better at shooting then hand to hand combat. Side chatting with her can reavel her past and if influences are high enough she can be trained to be a jedi. Then when she can hold a lightsaber it is easier for her to fight hand to hand than with a blaster because she can use force powers as well.\n\nHanharr: He is a bounty hunter wookie. Same planet as Mira but you need to choose darkside to get him. He is a rage-a-holic wookie when in rage mode increases his strength so high he is an unstoppable hand to hand combat machine. His special abilty is wookie rage it is the base form of wookie frenzy and wookie fury, over all idea is that  his strength goes up by alot for 60 seconds and he is able to kick major ass with it. Side chatting with him is fun. You can learn about his past and how he became a bounty hunter. There is a glitch which sometimes does NOT work but if it does it can increase his intellegence to over 200 making him the smartest person in the game but this glitch sometimes fails so try at your own risk!\n\nMical aka Disciple: he can only be in your party if you have choosen female main character from the start. He is a historian and scienctist. He is a shooter when you first meet him but you can make him a hand to hand fighter. His special ability is a walking medical station, when you talk to him you can make any medicen you need if you have the skill and ingreaditents. Side chatting with him can reveal he is force sensative and you can train him to be a jedi. Then he can have the ability to meditate with you. He can also heal you for free in chat because he double's as a medic of the team.\n\nHandmaiden aka the last handmaiden: she can only be in your party if you choose male main character from the start. She is an Echani fighter, so she is great at hand to hand combat. In the guide book it calls her the perfect body guard. Her special ability is echani fighting which can give her a stronger hand to hand combat sense. Side chatting with her is fun, she can train you in the art of echani fighting so you can be stronger at hand to hand combat as well. If you influence her enough and win enough sparing matches you can train her to be a jedi guardien so she can even better at fighting with a lightsaber and all.\n\nnow we move on to attributes, skills and leveling and Influenceing.\n\nStrength: this tells how physcially strong you are, the higher it is the strong you hand to hand combat is while fighting with a sword or lightsaber.\n\nDexterity: this tells how fast your reflexs are, the higher they are the more you can dodge and it corrasonds with blasters and shooting battles because you can shoot more accurately and faster with a higher DEX\n\nConstitution: is how much health you have, the higher this one is determins how much health you have. Also it makes your character harder to poison or other non physical attacks to harm your character. Also the higher constitution is says what level implant you can have, it starts from a basic level 12 CON implant to the highest of a level 18 CON implant.\n\nWisdom: determins how much force points you have to spend in battle or other force powers you may use. The higher this is the more you are able to resist force attacks from enemies.\n\nIntelligence: determins how smart you character is, the higher this is will give you skill points so you can have a higher skill to use the game. Sometimes this gives you additional dialogue options when talking to other characters.\n\nCharisma: yes it does increase you speech skill but over all it effect your force powers. The higher charisma is the harder your force powers can hit an oppoent. Also if you use an oppositie force power for instace say you are a dark jedi trying to use a lightside power, the cost per use will be less with a higher charisma.\n\nSkills:\n\nComputers: this tells how well you can work on a computer, the higher this is the less spikes you need to hack into a computer. In work bench you can create Lightsaber power cells and some lens with this. You can also make some armor and weapons upgrades with this skill too.\n\nRepair: this is for reparing, the higher this is the less parts you need to fix something in the game, this includes droids that might be hurt in your party if you try to repair them your self. In work bench you can make emitters and some armor and weapons upgrads too\n\nPersuade: is how well you can talk to others in the game, the higher this is the more likely you can talk a better reward out of people or get out of a sticky situation.\n\nSecurity: this determins how well you can pick a lock. The higher it is the less spikes you need to pick a lock. This skill in work bench can be used to make lightsaber, armor and weapons upgrades.\n\nAwareness: how well you can look around. Spoting people who are lieing to you in conversation or seeing hidden objects for the taking. This skill can be used in work bench for lightsaber, armor and weapons upgrades.\n\nTreat Injury: this skill is self explanitory, the higher it is the less med packs you need to heal your self. Also in work bench you can make some armor upgrades but this skill works best in med lab where you can make tons of medical items you would ever need.\n\nDemolition: how well you work on explosives. Landmines can be disabled and taken with a high enough skill, also  this can be used in work bench for armor, weapons and lightsaber upgrades. Also it can be used in med lab to make landmines and grnades for your use in battle.\n\nLeveling: In the sequal the level capping has been upgrade from 20 to 50. Most of the time you won't ever get up to level 50 unless you use the level glitch. But now you have a longer chance to be a jedi because in Kotor 1, you could only become a jedi when you reached the 3rd world/level of the game, by then you are either a level 8 or 10 character, then you would only have 10 to 12 levels to master being a jedi. But when you start the game from the start you are a jedi already with force abilities so you can start doing force powers from level 1.\n\nInfluenceing: In the game some speech checks are going to need influence, This is only for the characters in your party. It starts off as netural, but it can go either influence gained or loss, If you gain more it makes each character in your party easier to talk to, same goes for loss of influence. But sometimes in side chatting with certin characters if you don't have enough influence you cant progross on with the conversation. Its NOT important to the main story line but sometimes having a high influence with other party members you can learn new abilities you couldn't befor, or learn something secret about the characters past or learn new fighting tactics that you will never learn unless you have high enough influence.\n\nNow its time to talk about armor and weapons and upgrades and force powers and other misc things in the game.\n\nArmor: is split into light, medium and heavy. The heavier the armor the better the protection is. In the game there is  78 different types of armor including jedi robes. So you will have tons of choices if you are able find, buy or get the armors. Some armors restric jedi force powers but the robes do NOT so robes rock!\n\nArmor upgrades: are so very much improved over the fist Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic. For a quick recap in the 1st game  there were only 2 upgrades but you could NOT choose what you wanted to upgrade it was predetired what your armor would get upgraded. In KOTOR 2 here you can choose what you want to upgrade and how you upgrade. If you want more defense you can have that. If you want an upgrade with a health regerator you can now. There is over 60 choices between armor upgrades, if you have the skill to make them in work bench you can use them. 60 upgrades to mix and match as you choose compared to the 1st game of 2 with no choice in how you upgrade it.\n\nBlasters: in this game there are 66 different blaster pistols and riffles to choose from. In the 1st game there was only 25, so here in KOTOR 2 you are litterly getting doubled and them some of blaster pistols and riffles choices to choose from.\n\nBlaster Upgrades: Once again KOTOR 2 is a vast upgrade, in here you get 45 blaster upgrade choices you can make to mix and match how you want. In the 1st game you had 4 different parts to upgrade but you could not choose how you were to upgrade it, the upgrades came predetermined for you. Now in this game there are only 3 parts to upgrade, sure one less part to upgrade but now you get 45 choices and you can choose how and what you upgrade, more power? sure, more accuracy? yup you can do that. Plus in the 1st game you could only upgrade only 7 blasters out of the 25 in Kotor 1. Now in Kotor 2 you can upgrade pretty much all 66 blasters you come across.\n\nMelee weapons: The non lightsabers, in Kotor 2 there are 25 blades you can fight with. Its the same amount in Kotor 1 but where the differences lie are in the upgrades.\n\nMelee upgrades: In Kotor 1 you could only upgrade 6 blades with 3 choices of upgrades that are once again predetermined for you, In Kotor 2 you can mix and match your upgrades on how you want them to be.\n\nLightsabers: They have the same as Kotor 1 but upgrading is where the differences are.\n\nLightsaber upgrades: all lightsabers can be upgraded but in Kotor 1 you could only change the color of the blade and have 2 power crystals. Now in Kotor 2 you can change the color of the blade, have 2 power crystals and now you have have a power cell for more damage, a lens to focus the sabers power more and have an emitter for better protection, to which you can mix and match upgrades as you choose.\n\nLightsaber fighting forms: in the 1st kotor you could only fight one style, one vs many enemies. Now in Kotor 2 you can choose and learn up to all 7 forms, from fighting one vs many, to one on one, to one vs one with an lightsaber, to one vs blasters and more.\n\nForce Powers: you have the same base force powers as Kotor 1 cept now they added more, higher levels. New powers, like revive which is if you are the last one standing in your party and you use this power it brings your party back from the dead to keep on fighting. Or if you remember from the 1st game, Bastila had Battle meditiation which can make your allies stronger in battle and weaken your enemies, now in Kotor 2 you can use that power and more than Kotor 1 never ever had. You can even learn some people from other jedi's in speech talking.\n\nImplants: you can do more with implants now, instead of useing a fleat power to get them you now need consitution, but if you have a level 18 consitution you have all the implants. In Kotor 1 you only had a few types, In Kotor 2 you have many levels, from 12, 14, 16, and 18. Level 18 has the best, improving your main attributes and others, as well skills and other usefull techinquies you can use\n\nRandom Loot Generator: it depends on how high your level is. The higher your level is the more high level stuff you can find on people. Sure sometimes it sucks and sometimes its good, it all depends on how high your levels are.\n\nTime to talk about the pro's and con's of it all.\n\nStory Pro: to me it is more expanded than in Kotor 1 because you can go to more planets, do more things, have a cooler story line. New and old returning characters from the 1st game but they expanded it more in this game.\n\nStory Con: YES this game is cut. Im not going to sit here and tell you that everything is included because its not, the developers who made this game cut it quickly because they wanted to get this game for the holiday season. Some parts of speech are cut off you can tell that some characters in your party like Bao-Dur had more to say but didn't so they cut some of his speech out. Some other parts in the game were cut but if you are playing this for the very first time ever, you can NOT tell anything was cut at all. I certinally could not untill I saw that online alot of people were saying there were some things taken out from the game.\n\nCharacter over all: The party characters you travel with have upgraded in speach and talking, you can talk so much more and use them all in your party more in the game. I like what they did with their characters. Also that every human companion and Bao-Dur who is Zabrack can all be trained to be a jedi if they are not a jedi already. Who doesn't want more jedi's? In Kotor 1 out of all 9 character beside your character you only had 2 to 3 jedi's to choose from. Now in this game out of the 12 characters you have cept for Mandalore, the droids and if you went dark side hanharr the wookie, everyone in your whole party can be trained to be a jedi and fight with lightsabers and force powers. Vast improvement from the 1st game\n\nItems and Upgradeing pros: this has been the biggest thing I knowticed in the whole game. From playing the 1st game then going straight to this game I can feel how much I can mix, match and choose up upgrades I want with what armor and weapons I want.\n\nItem Cons: As I said before that some stuff was cut from the game, some of the small armor and robes and only 2 lightsabers were cut from the items here.\n\nOver all: I like this game way more than the 1st in pretty much everyway possible, even with the cuts the developers had in this game it is honestly so much better than Kotor 1, But that is just my and only my oppion here.

That said, I find that although I got the pop screen as it was advertised on the page when I bought it, I never need it. The mic pics up so well and clear that I don't have to have it an inch in front of me like my headphone mic. It's great for any mic need.

I decided to take the plunge, though, because I had $65 on my Amazon Gift Card balance. My Prime membership had expired, I hoped that I could use my Amazon Gift card balance to renew it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't appear to be possible. I wanted to treat myself, though, so I went ahead and took a chance on this e-gift card for Ulta so I could pick up some skin care and makeup necessities. Very glad that I did, despite the reviews. That being said, there are a few things that I have learned from buying e-gift cards on Amazon, and I hope these tips can help. First, for in-person orders, do not bother having them scan the bar code, it never works - instead, just read the numbers off to them, simple. Second, if you copy and paste the 16 digit card number, you will need to manually remove the spaces or else it won't register (that's how it is with Dominos, anyway). Dumb, I know, but if it isn't working, try removing the spaces just in case. Third, when shopping at Ulta.com you CANNOT use more than one gift card. Why is that a problem? Because to use the ENTIRETY of my Amazon balance, I had to purchase two separate cards in the amounts of $30 and $35. I didn't want any remaining balance lingering as I have no idea when I'll have the extra funds to renew my Prime membership. This was an inconvenience because I had to split my Ulta purchases into two separate orders. Fourth, apparently the recipient needs to have an Amazon membership. If you are gifting a young person who isn't able to make an Amazon account you could always send the gift card to yourself and then send the card number and pin to the recipient. I have purchased E-Gift Cards off of Amazon for the following companies: P.F. Chang's, Domino's, Ulta, Panda Express, and Chipotle, and haven't had any issues with any of them. It just sounds like Amazon customer service isn't very good at helping people troubleshoot technical issues Order was successful, and if you are still reading, I really hope that this review has helped you make a decision regarding whether or not to purchase. If you have the time, it is usually worthwhile to go for the physical card, but these E-Gift cards are still quite convenient if you are in a pinch or have a long-distance recipient.", "Does the job.

Our six year old son played with it for two days straight when he got it for Christmas, and soon his two older sisters were helping think of new ways to configure the marble run.  I was impressed because Quadrilla is very sturdy when it's assembled, which avoids the frustrations we sometimes see with racetracks or Lego buildings that fall apart.  I give this set five stars in all areas because it teaches physics, develops imagination and fine motor skills, and teaches children that not all fun toys have a joy stick, batteries or flashing lights.

Everything about this album is great, but some songs do stand out more than others, but that's okay.\n\n2112:  A roughly twenty minute long song that is behind the title of this album and it has some of the best music I have ever heard.  The opening overture is probably Rush's best instrumental piece and always gets me in the mood to rock it out and then we suddenly come to the lyrics with the portion Priests of Syrinx which is also one seriously great piece.  The other pieces are good as well, but the first two parts are just plain brilliance.\n\nOther great songs include A Passage to Bangkok and Twilight Zone which also show off the band's ability at executing great instrumentals, but they don't really hold up to the sheer power of the title song.  It's hard to be to follow-up act to a song such as 2112.\n\nSo, remember, if there is ONE album by Rush you essentially need to own it is going to be 2112.

It's difficult for many of the newer games to handle the 3-D fighting, but Soul Caliber pulls it off flawlessly.  It's not really that gory for those who object, but is violent enough to keep anyone entertained for hours on end.

It is very small, light, well built (not waterproof), and easy to use.  It comes partially electrically charged out of the box.  Following instructions, it paired to my iPhone 4 and iPad immediately without problems or the need to enter any security codes on the Apple devices.  I can now use either Apple device with a simple setting change on the MW600. What a great little unit.  I'm now walking around my house listening to music from my iPad.\n\nThe unit comes with detachable noise isolating earphones.  The cord to the left ear is much shorter than the cord to the right ear.  Sound is on par with good under $30 earphones, which is to say quite adequate.  Bluetooth sound quality is very good.  I hear no background noise, whistling, interference or other artifacts.  Voice and music sound are solid and are very listenable, almost as good as through wired earphones to my iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe MW600 also has an FM radio which picks up all my local stations.  Unfortunately it does not have FM station preset memories.  You must manually tune or scan for the next station.  This feature would be most welcome as I have ten very good FM stations in my local area.  FM sound quality is good.\n\nUsing it with my iPad playing music, I'm moving around my house, up to 30 feet away, into other rooms.  The device receives a signal at this 30 foot distance in other rooms through drywall.  Beyond this distance it cuts out.  I haven't attempted use outside of my house but it would problably be slightly more than 30 feet.  Reception distance is perfectly adequate and about the same as my other Bluetooth devices.\n\nTried it with my iPhone calling my home phone answering machine.  The mic works fine, without any background noise.  The unit stops other functions while it makes or receives a call.  Once the call is complete, the previous mode, such as music listening comes gradually back up to its previous volume.  Nice feature.\n\nThe receiver is a little tube, 2.5 inches long and ballpoint pen diameter, with a clip which attaches to my collar or inside shirt pocket.  The phone mic is on the end of the tube.  The little OLED display is easy to read and quite handy for changing and checking settings, including battery status.  It turns itself off after a few seconds to conserve power.  The earphone cords are different lengths as I've mentioned.  The left side is about seven inches long and the right side over a foot.  I like this as I can put the device in my shirt pocket, connect up the earplugs and not have alot of excess cord.  This arrangement doesn't allow the device to go into a pant pocket or be clipped to a belt.  For that, I'd need my other earphones with longer cords.  This is a great advantage with this unit.  I can use a variety of earphone/headphones.\n\nAlso included is a small wall charger with mini-USB plug on the end.  I also received two additional sets of rubber earplug covers to accomodate different sized ear openings.  The instruction sheet is thorough and complete.\n\nI'm really happy with this great little bluetooth device.  It replaces Motorola S305 headphones which never really fit right and always felt strange when wearing eyeglasses.", "This is such an inspiring book and I highly recommend it to anyone considering it!

It is like a bronzed brown with a tiny touch of a pink tone if you compare to other browns. This eye shadow contains a shimmer but not sparkle.  The pencil is similar to MAC Shadestick in texture, but it does not set as fast as Shadestick does.  This is a 2 edged sword in that the fact that it does not immediately set gives you time to blend and smudge a bit.  Once set, it does not move for much of the day.\n\nThere is no perfumed odor to the pencil, although it has a slight odor from the chemicals and ingredients that fades after the shadow sets.\n\nHowever, I did find that when applied on my eyelid, it did begin to crease after about four hours or so- by the end of the day, much was missing on my eyes.\n\nThis was remedied somewhat by applying this crayon over top of an eyeshadow primer.  I used Too Faced Shadow Insurance and also tested with Milani's eye primer and both did help it not to crease as much.  If my eyes watered, however, it did come off quite easily.\n\nAll in all, this color is very beautiful.  It would work on cool or warmish skin tones (very fair red heads might find it too pinkish), and the staying power is good as well.  If you use it over an eyeshadow primer / base, you can easily get an entire day's wear out of it.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the seams are a little bulky causing it to bulge out a little but most people probably wouldn't even notice.

I didn't yet have my driver's license and lived 10 miles from the nearest theater, out in the country, so had to rely on mom or friends with licenses (of which I had none) to get to movies - and I had a minimal allowance and didn't work outside of the plentiful chores at home. Thus I didn't see a lot of movies, and I really had no interest in horror at that point, and didn't really know directors or writers. The fact that the guy who wrote, produced, and co-edited (uncredited) this film was the same guy behind my previous summer's favorite \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was just something I didn't catch. And for whatever reason, I've never caught up to it in all the years since, still not being a huge horror fan and no longer being a huge Spielberg fan.\n\nBut last night I finally did, and what was I thinking leaving this so long? This is Spielberg really hitting the core of his suburban-southwestern-America-as-the-world mythology, his nuclear family beset by strangeness and chaos from beyond, and hitting it supercharged on all cylinders. Interestingly enough the only reference to a specific place here is a quick mention of \"I-74\", which runs from Iowa to North Carolina - but the feel of the place to me wasn't much different than that of \"E.T.\" or \"Close Encounters\", obviously the two films with which it has the closest affinity. It's Everywhere USA I suppose - everywhere outside of the Northeast, anyway. Flyover country.\n\nOf course this is credited to director Tobe Hooper - the man behind \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"Lifeforce\" among others - but it feels Spielbergian all the way through, from the pans over the tract housing, to the cutesy kids, to the visual references to buddy George Lucas' work to the playing of one of Spielberg's favorite films, \"A Guy Named Joe\" on TV. In fact, the film opens with a TV, as the station goes off the air after midnight (I guess that'll date the film to many) and we're left with static. The story is pretty simple - a nice, young suburban family consisting of parents Steve & Diane (Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams), and kids Dana, Robbie and Carol Anne (Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robbins and Heather O'Rourke) live in a modern, bland but very comfortable large suburban home and are beset by a demonic presence which eventually snatches Carol Anne away after some less harmful fun, leaving her parents to try to get her back through use of parapsychologists and a medium/mystic. The film builds rather slowly for its first half hour, then escalates pretty quickly - which works well because you'd wonder why the family doesn't leave right away otherwise. From about a third of the way in, it's a roller-coaster ride every bit as exciting as Raiders but there's a lot more going on underneath I think.\n\nSteve and Diane love each other and seem to be fairly committed - this is a rare Spielberg happy family with few problems - on the outside. Sure they're a little distracted, they smoke a little too much dope maybe (this was a bit of a surprise) and they're not terribly concerned about the kids' nightmares at first - but there's nothing really wrong here that is their fault. Except that they're shallow and just don't seem to pay all that much attention to what's going on around them, don't seem to have much inner life. Spielberg and Hooper build the early part of the film quite carefully - subtle moments like Diane's comment to Steve to \"reach back into our past, when you used to have an open mind\" show us that this is a couple that has chosen this rather dull and conformist existence; later we start to feel that they also are going through life blindly and purposelessly. The one scene we have with Steve on his job (he's a salesman for the very same models of homes that he lives in) he seems a little distracted, uninterested, having to dredge up how to sell the home rather than really showing enthusiasm. The house the family lives in is the setting for over 90% of the film, their sanctuary, their only world.\n\nBut then the supernatural forces take over their lives - they have to let others in, and the \"ghostbusters\" (well, two of the three) show themselves to be very serious and very aware of what they might be dealing with. Beatrice Straight, as Dr. Lesh, the psychologist in charge, and Zelda Rubinstein as the psychic eventually called in to form something like an exorcism, are very clear that there are powerful forces - that they absolutely believe in but cannot truly understand - at work; that this situation calls into question our most basic beliefs - but it's never quite clear what if anything Diane and Steve believe in, other than their daily existence of working, sending the kids off to school, etc. At first I thought that the reclaiming of Carol Anne would have been a good ending for the film - but they have to actually go in and fight the monster lurking at the heart both of the house and their own shallow psyches, and though they escape physically unharmed, at the end the dream house is gone, and there is a palpable sense of defeat as the bloodied family retreats to a hotel, pushing the symbol of their solipsism, a TV, outside.\n\nI haven't seen enough of Tobe Hooper's work to really be able to say that this fits in any way with his directorial \"vision\"; it's pretty clear that Spielberg's is an equal, if not the presiding, voice here. Maybe the photography is a little less pretty, maybe it's a little more gruesome and a little less sentimental than his other work, but whether that's coming from director or writer/producer I'm not sure I care - this is the most clear-eyed and pessimistic of Spielberg's early films, still plenty full of the gosh-wow (the FX look pretty good for a film of this period and the scares are still there) but on the whole a pretty harsh indictment of the shallowness of the suburban fantasy-life and of the denial and repression of history - as we find out, to no one's surprise, that the development our heroic family has been living in is an old burial ground, never de-consecrated, never forgotten, at least by the dead. They don't, in the end, manage to bring anybody over to the \"other side\" - but they do cause enough trauma to prevent any typical Spielbergian happy ending from glossing over.\n\nPretty much tied with \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" for my favorite film with Spielberg's name on it.", "I bought these for use with the P90X program.

The main disk contains the 1942 re-release, which did away with interscene placards, replacing them with a voiceover by Chaplin himself. The second disk included the original 1925 silent release. Both versions were accompanied by a wonderful piano arrangement that was timed with the movie action. The second disk also contains a \"making of\" shorts that described Chaplin's off-screen romances with his leading ladies as well as footage of an older Chaplin reprieving one of his movie routines. Another short describes the effect that Chaplin had on an African filmmaker. The extras are by no means comprehensive, but have enough meat to satisfy the casual student of Chaplin and early cinema.\n\nThe film is terrific and sometimes funny, and always watchable. Chaplin's \"Little Tramp\" character delves into the Alaskan wilderness, seeking his fortune as a gold prospector. He encounters other prospectors, good and bad, and falls in love with the lovely Georgia, who seems at first not to notice him. There is great pathos as well as comedy in the film. A scene in which Chaplin prepares a New Years' Eve party for Georgia and her friends, who have forgotten their promise to attend, is quite affecting. The misery is offset somewhat by one of Chaplin's great routines -- set in a scene that imagines how the party would have gone -- in which Chaplin sticks forks into two dinner rolls and makes these \"feet\" dance beneath his sad sack face. Other notable scenes include one in which the Little Tramp, being thrown out of the rude cabin he shares with Black Larsen, slips and slides in his struggle against a fierce wind that blows him back into the cabin. Another scene in which Larsen fights another prospector for control of a shotgun -- managing to point it at the Little Tramp no matter where he flees -- is perfectly-choreographed and fraught with comedic tension. AN early scene, in which a lone Chaplin navigates a narrow mountain ledge -- sometimes followed by a live bear -- are beautifully timed.\n\nI preferred the 1925 version to the slicker 1942 release, but it's nice that both versions are here. YMMV. The film quality was superb, almost too perfect, and Chaplin's pancake makeup was quite obvious, especially in close-ups. You'll wonder whether a little-used print was located, or whether this version was cleaned up digitally. In any event, \"The Gold Rush\" disks is both educational and entertaining.

I checked out various sanders at my local Home Depot and talked with some local contractors. I narrowed down my choice to this or the Porter-Cable.  In the end I decided on the Makita for the following reasons:1.  The Porter-Cable is simply too heavy.  I use this sander in the vertical as well as horizontal positions.  It is heavy enough to be substantial and has a powerful motor, but is still easy enough to use with one hand in many different positions. 2.  The dust collector is in a very unobtrusive location compared to the Porter-Cable, in addition it really works.  There really isn't much dust produced when using this sander. 3.  The flat back allows it to be clamped to a table and used as a parts sander.  The variable speed control really comes in handy here. 4.  Price wasn't a big concern for me, I was going to buy the sander that fit my needs.  For someone who needs a medium duty belt sander that will be used in a variety of job I recommend this one highly!  Some other larger/smaller units may be better at specific jobs, but this one is really a jack of all trades. 5.  The motor is good, not a monster, but powerful and able to sustain heavy sanding for long periods of time without excessive heat.  In addition, the brushes can be easily replaced. 6.  Belt tracking mechanism worked flawlessly.  One person in one of the reviews here complained about belt tracking.  If you adjust the belt carefully it stays on track for a looong time.  Maybe that person had a defective unit, or more likely, a belt that wasn't perfectly square.  There is no way a non square belt will track correctly no matter how much you adjust the tracking screw.

They are ready for the proclick binders.  I like that you can add or subtract things as needed.", "The best way to review this game is to draw comparisons with GT 3 & 4, since most people considering this game probably have these already; and of course, GT 3 & 4 are considered by many to be the best racers on the PS2.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I have been playing racing/driving games for 25 years.  I am very particular when it comes to this genre.  In the short amount of time that I have owned Toca, it has become one of my all-time favorites.\n\nGraphics:  The GT series has the more realistic graphics.  Toca has an arcade racer look, sporting more vibrant colors with less detailed textures.  There are some aliasing issues but the texture \"sparkle\" effect that's prominent in the GT series is not as noticeable in Toca.  The car models in GT look much better, especially in the third person view.  However, Toca has a nice cockpit view that all racing games should emulate; this is the only view to play this game in.  You can actually look to your left and right by clicking the shoulder buttons.  When you crash, the windshield cracks making it difficult to see ahead.\n\nControl:  Toca wins this one hands down.  This is one area I don't like about the GT series.  Toca has a very intuitive control scheme that anyone can get into right away, but without feeling cheap.  The GT series control has always been too floaty for my taste.  I remember playing GT 3 for the first time and having to struggle just to stay on the road...and this happening to a guy that has been playing racers for 25 years.  Yeah, you do get used to the GT series control scheme, but you should not have to.  The physics in Toca are better than GT, in my opinion.  This is the first game since Sega's F355 that makes me feel as if I'm actually controlling a car.  I cannot wait to see Codemasters' efforts on the PS3.\n\nA.I.:  Again, Toca wins this one easily.  The GT series is infamous for its cheap A.I.  This is not the case with Toca.  In addition, you cannot get away with bumping up against the other cars in Toca.  Not only will your car sustain damage, but you will get penalized for careless driving.  Your pit man talks to you along the way and he'll warn you when you bump into the opposing cars.  If you remain careless, you receive a black flag and get penalized on your time.  If you continue your carelessness, you are disqualified.  In the GT series, you can bump against opposing cars while entering a corner to gain an advantage.  This technique is not only cheap but unrealistic.  These are areas in the GT series that should be addressed.  Toca gets is right.\n\nVariety:  When it comes to the number of vehicles available, Toca cannot touch GT.  However, Toca has an advantage in the number of tracks and variety of vehicle types; I would much rather have a larger number of tracks and fewer vehicles.  There are no fantasy tracks here; all the tracks are real world.  Although there are fewer cars to choose from, the variety is much greater.  You can choose from open wheel, Touring, Endurance, Stock Car, Rally Sport, Kart, Super Truck, Dune Buggy, Baha Bug, Monster Truck, Mini GT, etc.  No other racing game offers this kind of variety.\n\nIn closing, this is a must-own game for driving game enthusiasts who own a PS2.", "Perfect sneaker, exactly what I was looking for, simple and great for light walking in the neighborhood.", "Great summer ice tea.

Use The Whole\nsystem very very very effective!", "In spite of its flaws (and there are a few) this is one of the greatest  horror flicks of all time.  At the same time, I find it difficult to put  Poltergeist in the same genre as other classics like Psycho and The  Exorcist.  That's because Poltergeist is really a strange blend of humor  (both blunt and subtle) and terror.  It's a mixture that seldom works (see  April Fool's Day, among others), but is orchestrated perfectly here.\nThe  film's opening scene is unforgettable, with little Carol Anne (Heather  O'Rourke) being summoned in the middle of the night by creepy, droning  voices emanating from the television.  The next 30 minutes are rather  light-hearted and jocose as we are introduced to the Freelings, a  middle-class suburban family enjoying a seemingly normal, happy life.  Yet  a threatening backdrop hovers over this little piece of Shangri-la.  As we  bear witness to several brilliant foreshadowing techniques, especially the  scenes with the clown and the tree, disquieted feelings of an impending  nightmare enter our sub-conscious.  And then, almost without warning, the  incubus reveals itself...and true hell commences.  Watch this film and  you'll see how well it plays upon some of the worst childhood fears -- have  you ever been scared of what may be hiding in your closet or under your  bed?  Those fears are likely to return after watching Poltergeist.\nThe  movie has a fine supporting cast and the special effects (by 1982  standards) are superb.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is both enchanting and  haunting at the same time.  Also pleasing to note is how the producers  managed to make a grade-A horror flick without a single character death.  I  find it difficult to make the same claim of any other \"horror\"  film made in the last 25 years.", "great for projects", "Point of Entry is filled with simple hard rock songs with classic rockin riffs from Glenn Tipton and KK Downing and amazing vocals from super talented Rob Halford!

It has a sort of upbeat neo-50s doo-wop beat that accents the song's lyrics, and it isn't quite as racy as Madonna's other music, but that's okay -- it's an 80s pop song.

Thank you", "do the job intended", "For those who love movies full of suspenseful content, this is a great pick. The movie 'Flight Plan,' successfully twists and turns the plot without giving away the end until the perfect moment. Jodie Foster plays the character of a disgruntled mother, distressed by the loss of her husband. She takes him back for burial from Germany to NY, her daughter with her. When Foster's character and her 6 year old daughter fall asleep, the action picks up quite significantly, and very successfully with so small a setting. (It's on a plane, guys) When she wakes up, her young daughter is gone. Frantically she searches, but to no avail...and then comes the twist...no one remembers seeing a little girl about 6 years old on the plane that matches the description of her daughter. The acting is incredible, especially that of Jodie Foster (Contact, Panic Room) and Sean Bean (National Treasure, Lord of the Rings). The setting contributes to the mood for the plane gives a sense of isolation, yet through her knowledge of the plane business (Foster's character is an engineer), she essentially takes us to many different areas that regular customers have never seen, adding to the mysterious and suspenseful mood as well as the twisting plot. The movie brings in many modern themes associated with today, and even has a few bits of comic relief that are so essential to a suspenseful plot, for it keeps the audience near the edge of their seats, but not toppling out of them. I would recommend paying the outrageous 9 dollar fee to go see this movie, for seeing it on the big screen I am sure will do much to add to the effect. The audience feels Foster's anxiety, can believe the actions of all characters, and are surprised and satisfied until the very end.", "Just awesome. I only wish there were more shades. I love that all I need to paint are these, a brush, and a mini bottle of water. So amazing.", "It's not too difficult for a game developer to make a game look good. You rarely find a game with ugly or awesome graphics, and so it's to Ubi Soft's credit that in Splinter Cell they have created some of the best graphics on the Xbox generation consoles. The character models and animations, the textures, the small details, the different filters to view the environments through, and the lighting. The beautiful lighting. No other game has been able to reproduce these lighting effects: the different shades of lighting, realistic shadows that wrap around other objects in the game. The lighting helps make every little object look that much more real. Lighting has never looked so good, though it can be your worst enemy, so you might have to shoot that darn bulb out every once in a while. Ubi Soft also revolutionized \"soft physics,\" which refers to objects such as curtains, webs, and the like. Other games use soft physics to some extent today, but not with quite the detail and realism Ubi Soft used them. Playing around with a curtain can be so much fun you might forget you have 30 seconds to defuse that bomb.\n\nOf course, graphics alone don't make a game, but Splinter Cell does magnificently in all categories. The soundtrack is excellent and adds to the mood of the game. Nothing makes your heartbeat faster than when the bass \"dun!\" sounds to signal you've been noticed. Staying with the attention to detail theme, Ubi Soft also worked hard on the sound effects department. The number of different textures you can walk on and the different sounds each one produces is brilliant, and it demonstrates what kind of hard work went into the game. To fully enjoy and appreciate this game requires not only your eyes, but your ears.\n\nSo far I have only touched on the technical aspects of the game. For a game to be fun, however, requires great gameplay, and on that count Splinter Cell delivers. The game keeps you on your toes, with sweaty palms and cheers beckoning from your throat the moment a checkpoint arrives. There many ways to get past a given part of the game. Want to gun down every terrorist you see? Sure go ahead, but it's not easy with the excellent AI. You need to carefully plan all of your shots and your placement of Sam Fisher. Want to sneak around without killing anyone? Go for it, but again it's not easy with the excellent AI. Sure the guards run their pre-scripted routes, but mess up and your toast. You need to use the environment to your advantage, and the levels are so well designed that you might need to play through the game again to notice all of the different ways you can complete a level.\n\nWhat I love about this game is the AI. The enemies sometimes notice things a little too easily, but they are never dumb. They might hear a sound that causes them to search around, but if you hide well enough they eventually go back on their route. The only other stealth game that has AI this good is the Metal Gear Solid series. What most stealth games do wrong is punish you for making the tiniest mistake. Sometimes enemies will know you are there before anybody sees you. Not so for these two games. The difference between them, however, is that Splinter Cell relies on hiding in the shadows, where Metal Gear Solid relies on hiding behind physical objects.\n\nThe game does have its moments where it can be unforgiving. There is a lot of trial and error. Sam Fisher is not a human tank, so fire fights can very quickly lead to your death. Oftentimes your death is due to your own error, but there are times when the AI does seem to spot you a little too easily. There will be many times when alarms go off and you have no idea why. Also, the game doesn't do a very good job of briefing you on who you can't kill, and sometimes the only way you learn is by killing said person. Despite all of this, the game was my favorite of the year when it came out back in 2002, and it deserves the highest praise.", "I totally enjoyed reading Claimed.  It was well written and developed.  I read it through in one siting as I was so entranced with the story.  Look forward to reading more from this writer.", "This book is the second in the series, following our introduction to the Three Investigators in \"The Secret of Terror Castle.\"  As we learned in the first book, the Three Investigators are Jupiter Jones, Pete Crenshaw and Bob Andrews.  Jupiter is the intelligent, sometimes inadvertently arrogant member of the group who has a tendency to be condescending.  Pete Crenshaw is typically the muscle of the group.  Pete is usually quite fearless.  Bob Andrews, who begins the series with a broken leg, works at the library and handles records and research for the group.\n\nIn this story, the boys are investigating the case of a missing parrot at the request of Alfred Hitchcock.  A friend of Mr. Hitchcock had recently purchased a parrot that stutters, and shortly after the purchase the parrot disappeared.  The Three Investigators are on the case!\n\nInitially, the boys, and perhaps the reader, might wonder whether this mystery is going to be interesting.  Never fear.  The boys soon encounter a renowned art thief and a suspicious fat man who threatens the boys.  The three boys also discover that there are more parrots missing and that their mystery has compounded.  The mystery deepens as the boys learn that a mysterious man trained the parrots and the parrots may be speaking a riddle that could lead to a treasure.  This story has enough twists that many adults might find it entertaining.\n\nQuite a few children's mystery book series have become classics.  Most people are familiar with Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, and Tom Swift.  Even the Boxcar Children are relatively well-known.  However, Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators were well-written books that appear to have been largely forgotten.  The novels offered an intelligent, interesting and more contemporary alternative to many of the earlier classic series.  Many people recall the earlier series well, but the Three Investigators series, which Robert Arthur created and which debuted in 1964, has, for now, largely been overshadowed by the other series.  Fortunately, all of these books are available either from Amazon or from other internet sources.\n\nIf you are looking for mystery books for children and you are looking for an alternative to the Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys and Tom Swift, I highly recommend the Three Investigator series.\n\nEnjoy!", "These are fantastic guitar picks.  I use several brands of picks depending on the guitar I am using and the music being played.  I prefer a heavy pick, which these are.  Sound wise, I find these create a nice tone - warm and clean - when playing electric guitar.  Yes, to an extent, a pick is a pick, but some cheaply made picks will not hold up very long or can be somewhat scratching on strings or slip easily.\n\nAs far as handling, I usually like something with a grip, so I like a Planet Waves or Dunlop Tortex with a textured surface on the sides to prevent slipping.

(If you were wondering if it makes any difference, yes, hallelujah, yes, for us long-time Rush fans who were both screwed by Mercury's lack of quality control in the 80s when it came to replacing our vinyl on CD, and remember how much huger the sound on that vinyl was...)  Granted, the 2112 source tapes and recording equipment were several years older (circa 1976), so they naturally fall a bit short of the full \"umph\" of 1981's Moving Pictures, but the remaster treatment does excellent justice in much the same way-there's so much more surrounding _presence_ for all the instruments.  (A healthy dose of volume always helps, too.  :-)  I particularly like how Alex's acoustic guitars \"sproing\" at you in the 2112 Overture.  Indeed, A/B'ing the old 2112 CD issue with the new, I was struck by how flat and squashed the mixing was on the old version, compared to the \"liveness\" of the remaster.  Nice to crank this one as well!  (Remember those hot afternoons in high school when you were sunk in your parents' living room chair/sofa with this on? )\nOther reviews have done enough justice to the album, so I'll only point out that the title track is by far the best and most comprehensively designed, rehearsed and recorded part to the album.  The B-side (Passage to Bangkok through Something for Nothing) has some nice moments to it, to hear a young band's energy, particularly on \"Something for Nothing,\" but also \"Lessons,\" and the acoustic (and bass) guitar parts (simple, but beautiful) on \"Tears\", but all those B-side tunes (with the possible exception of  \"Something\") are really prototypes that don't really do justice to Rush's later composition capabilities in the more \"commercial\" song format.  (\"Passage to Bangkok\"'s live reworking on Exit...Stage Left is something to hear and compare, however...)  Keep a light, unbiased, or at least, amused attitude when you listen to these B-side tunes, and realize it's about a young band working hard with limited time to write on the road in the mid-1970s but still having fun, and you'll come to appreciate at least some of them, too, if not love them like the title opus.\nOne other nice touch:  unlike the old CD issue and the vinyl re-issues, the 2112 remaster includes the full set of lyrics with the CD foldout.\nNot that I really want to shell out the dough a fourth time, but if Mercury and/or the band is listening (?)-a lot of longtime Rush fans would REALLY like the individual sections to \"2112\" and \"Hemispheres\" itemized as \"songs\" on the digital counter (as was done with \"2112\" on the live album Different Stages), if possible, for the next remaster...makes us instrumentalists (and listeners) exceedingly happy when it comes to learning/remembering the separate parts, eh? :-)", "I had not used Prismacolor before as they aren't usually within my budget but I received these as a gift.

Sadly, there are a couple others that add to the criticism of the period as being pure \"camp.\"  The desecration of Mussorgsky's \"Night on Bald Mountain,\" reborn as \"Night on Disco Mountain,\" and Walter Murphy's monster smash, \"A Fifth of Beethoven,\" are examples of the worst of disco.\n\nBut the album's pluses far outweigh its minuses, with Yvonne Elliman's \"If I Can't Have You,\" KC and The Sunshine Band's \"Boogie Shoes,\" the close-to-11-minute-long \"Disco Inferno,\" and a second helping of \"More than a Woman,\" this time by Tavares, as the strongest of the non-Bee-Gees tracks.\n\nIf any album belongs in a time capsule as \"the way we were,\" then the soundtrack to \"Saturday Night Fever\" should be that one.", "This is the PERFECT product for elementary teachers who need to sharpen a variety of sizes and shapes of pencils.

A few strokes on a sharpening steel and this one's ready to go again. I haven't liked folding knives for field dressing before because they tend to get gummed up and are difficult to clean out. The E-Z-Out Jr cleans up very easily with just warm water. One tip I can pass along is that the tip is very sharp and can easily puncture the guts if you're not careful. I lay my index finger along the back of the knife and just over the tip then insert it under the skin, sharp edge up and 'unzip' the chest and paunch. Its compact size makes this very easy since the whole thing fits in your hand. Working inside the body cavity is just as easy for the same reason.

There are few NES titles that offer the kind of challenging gameplay that the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game offered. Instead of an obligatory beat 'em up style, this game is an action platformer. Also noteworthy about this game is the addition of other weapons, such as the shurikens, the triple shurikens, the boomerang (not really a ninja weapon), and the devestating kiai (usually referred to as the \"scroll weapon\"). This unique aspect of using other weapons is a fantastic part of the game that is missing from the two other TMNT titles (I don't even bother considering the Tournament Fighters game on NES).  You can also switch turtles at any given time, and even if you lose one you can rescue him later.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the cover art. This picture of the turtles all wearing Raphael's signature red bandana mystified me as a kid, but obviously now I know that the turtles originally all wore red in the comics before the tv show. It's still a really great picture of the turtles and looks better than any other TMNT video game cover. Don't be fooled by the publisher \"ULTRA\"...somehow, the game is still property of Konami.\n\nAlso, this game owned the top spot of Nintendo Power's Top 10 for quite a while on its' way to winning Game Of The Year honors. I'm pretty sure that it sold over a million copies, and this game was owned or played by tons of gamers. I've come to the conclusion that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a mandatory part of an NES collection, and any hardcore NES gamer has to beat this game. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, BattleToads, Zelda II, and Batman are the games that really deliver the quintessential Nintendo game experience, complete with extremely hard difficulty. Fortunately, none of these titles is terribly expensive these days. These are the games that many owned or played, but few actually beat. Beating these games is still something to brag about today.\n\nGamers that lamented the difficulty of the first TMNT game would get softer games in the sequels. TMNT 2 The Arcade Game is a butchered port of the arcade gem that offers the least amount of variety. TMNT III The Manhattan Project is a cleaned up version of the second game, and actually is probably the best beat 'em up on NES (Double Dragon II The Revenge is a close second). Still, I prefer the action platforming of the first game. Enough unique elements not only distinguish the first game from the rest, but also offer a different game altogether from the other two. Just like Mario 2 and Zelda II, it is once again nice to have a fresh and radically different game.\n\nAnyone that has ever whined about the difficulty of Stage II underwater is a pitiful gamer. The dam can easily be beaten without losing a turtle. The real challenge in this game is the two great equalizers. Equalizer number one is the spiked wall and equalizer number two is the final hall. No matter how well you have played up until near the end of stage 4, the spiked wall screens can erase all your progress very quickly. This is a part of the game that can prevent even the best Nintendo gamers from being able to beat the game since all it requires is one misstep. Not as merciless as The Murder Wall in Kid Chameleon's Bloody Swamp, but still frustrating. The final hallway is a nasty little endurance round, and is harder than the final boss Shredder.\n\nThe ending of the game is fantastic. Splinter uses the mutagen ray gun to turn back into human form. It's like a happy ending to the last episode of season 1 (Shredded and Splintered) and very cathartic. It reminds me almost of the Batman ending where Batman punches the Joker off the clocktower, murdering him (also a deviation from the source material).\n\nAbsolutely mandatory for any Nintendo gamer, and a must if you want to be a Nintendo master.", "This is a very nice looking digital caliper for the money.

As usual, this is a fairly \"closed-room\" mystery, with Hercule Poirot summoned to solve a murder that took place at a large estate in a small English town.  Although Christie always throws out plenty of red herrings, in this book it was more subtly done than usual, so that the identity of the murderer wasn't quite so obvious.  Also, the fact that the victim was a child lent a more somber, even sinister tone to the story.  The character of Ariadne Oliver was well done, not at all as ridiculous as she is in some of Christie's other books.\n\nThe whole motive behind the murder was, when revealed, somewhat convoluted, but that is typical of Christie.

Unfortunately, there haven't been too many since then, but Square Enix reunites with Nintendo once again for the Nintendo DS game, Mario Hoops 3-On-3. Mario Hoops was initially intended to be an original intellectual property of Square's, but you'd never be able to tell from the final product-every facet of the Mario universe and its sports spinoffs permeates throughout this game's entirety. As with Mario Kart, Mario Strikers, Mario Tennis and the like, there's the option of initiating unbeatable super-goals if you're fast enough or in the clear, gimmicky courses to play on and of course that notorious item-induced chaos that can rapidly and randomly turn the tide of a game.\n\nThe big gimmick of Mario Hoops 3-On-3 is its (intended) control setup-you dribble, pass, and shoot the ball with taps, sweeps and swishes of the stylus. This may sound fun or unique, but unfortunately it really only ends up being so in practice mode, because in the heat of an actual game, you won't be able to control your team as efficiently as you'd like with this wonky method. The DS is top-heavy enough as it is, but having to hold the entire console AND properly operate the D-pad with your non-dominant hand while using the stylus with your right just makes for awkward, uncomfortable control settings, unless you're resting the DS against a solid surface-play for just a few minutes and you'll find your hands getting sore. Thankfully you have the option of playing the game with buttons, which is significantly easier and the manner in which I decided to play pretty much throughout the whole game. While I was perfectly content playing the game with buttons, it is a bit disappointing that the game's big gimmick ended up falling completely flat.\n\nAnother control issue is the setup of the Special Shot-a super shot which goes straight for the hoop and can only be executed if a certain symbol (different for each character) is tapped out twice on the touch screen. Even while playing with buttons, this is the only way to execute a Special Shot. As a result, you'll only end up using Special Shots about as often as you would Mega Strikes in the Mario Strikers games (not very), possibly even less so. This is too bad, because the Special Shot animations are some of the most pleasing and exciting visuals in the game; but thankfully for pure aesthetics' sake there's a `Challenges' mode in which you can practice using each character's Special Shot.\n\nAn issue that recurs consistently in Mario sports titles is the utter lack of effort your teammates make to help you at all unless you're in direct control of them-while you're controlling the one character who has the ball, the other two will run around randomly or not move at all, making zilch effort to defend against the CPU's persistent offense; because of this, you should really only pass the ball if a teammate is relatively nearby, or you could toss it right into the hands of an opponent.\n\nWhile this may sound like a lot of griping, the gameplay itself is pretty fun-you select a team of three to lead you through an exhibition (VS. match) or tourney (1-player mode) of basketball games. You can dribble, pass the ball, execute slam dunks or try to make a shot from far away, and perform various defensive moves when the opposing team is in possession of the ball. As previously explained, these moves are all much simpler when performed with buttons-you press B to dribble, Y or A to pass left or right, and X to shoot when in possession of the ball; you can press B to attempt a steal or use items, Y or A to sidestep left or right, or X to jump or block when you don't have the ball. There are also advanced tactics, such as charging the ball to increase the likelihood of making the shot when further away, or jump-steals, which allow you to knock the ball away just as the opposition is attempting to make a basket.\n\nBoth fortunately and unfortunately, items are the wild card-and as with other Mario titles, some of them are a bit overpowered and make for unfair or unexpected happenings in the gameplay. Lightning makes everyone else on the court fall, Spiny Shells home in on the ball and create a massive explosion (meaning there is no way of avoiding it unless you attempt to make a shot before it hits), and Stars grant complete and total invincibility for a surprisingly long period of time, basically allowing the user a free shot. You'll have to be particularly careful that the AI opponents don't get ahold of some of these devastating items, because they tend to bolt after them the moment they appear, particularly on higher difficulty levels.\n\nIn the 1-player tourney, you'll go through Cups in a very Mario Kart-like fashion, and beating all three of the tourney's games wins you a trophy; to win gold or silver trophies as opposed to bronze, you must not just win, but win by a specific margin of points-which is very easy at first but progressively more difficult as you go on. Thankfully, unlike some other Mario sports titles, for the most part, the CPU opponents rarely reach that obnoxious level of cheap, outrageous difficulty that can leave a player too frustrated to go on, although once you start playing some of the Cups on Hard, some of your opponents are a little too precise with their shooting and stealing, and as previously mentioned, the item-induced chaos and court hazards can just plain be too much to keep track of, especially if you're playing with the stylus and can't sweep or swish fast enough.\n\nGraphically, the game is actually very impressive-this could have easily been an N64 title, as nearly all of the background scenery is vivid and colorful, and some of the extra aesthetic tidbits are a pure joy to behold. The game is also blessed with an excellent soundtrack, with great, exciting beats to bump along to while you're dashing down the court. Arguably the game's greatest asset is its massive plethora of hidden goodies and unlockables-there are 11 hidden characters, 4 hidden courts and a multitude of alternate character costumes and ball colors to unveil throughout the gameplay.\n\nOne of the biggest draws is the addition of the Final Fantasy characters-you can unlock White Mage, Black Mage, Ninja, Moogle and Cactuar as playable characters, all of whom are very fun to play but unfortunately all also require relatively exhaustive tasks to be completed before you can unlock them. I have yet to give the wireless multiplayer a try, but I have a feeling it's exactly the same as other DS games' wireless or download play (and no, you can't play locally or online; you can only play against friends in the immediate vicinity who also have DS consoles). Overall, it's a nice DS game, and arguably the best Mario sports title on a handheld console so far; however, its replay value is slim once you've completed all or most of the Cups, and in my opinion to really be able to enjoy the game, you have to get used to playing it with buttons. Ultimately, it's a fun (albeit gimmicky) sports title.", "These are great tasting and they are small. Some other brands have very large fish and only 4 or 5 fish.

The line up also included Fran Sheehan on bass(very talented) and Sib Hasian on drums, all band members are extremely talented and well-versed on thier insturments.

Mario Sunshine's gaming environment can accurately be described in one word: staggering.  From neck-straining roller coasters that would shame Six Flags, to underwater oceanic worlds worthy of a Discovery channel special, Mario's new adventure is a orgiastic feast for the eyes at every turn.\nHis adventure is no less satisfying.  His new ability, the water jet-pack/nozzle gizmo, at first made me skeptical of the game, but upon picking up the FLUDD, one realizes the infinite range of motion and dimension it adds to the game.  Mario can suddenly hover, attack in 360 degrees, backflip with a powerful frontal attack, and not to mention... annoy his friends by gratuitously squirting them in the face.  He'll need all of those strategies and more as he faces his largest set of challenges yet: From battling gigantic elastic squid, to exterminating dozens of ghastly ghosts on a haunted beach, to hunting down your own shadowy clone (or so it would seem...), Mario faces task after task of the weirdest of the weird.  And even after he's beaten the game, that represents just about half of the goals to be reached in the game, with tons of hidden missions and extra-difficult bonus missions.  The replay value here is unmatched by any previous Mario game.\nAnd, old-schoolers need not fear, there's plenty in this game for you as well.  For any fans of the older platform-based puzzles that defined very early Mario's and even the last installment for the N64, you will be amazed and alternately befuddled by the \"secret\" missions embedded in your quest.  Complete with 3-D rotating, bouncing and our old favorite VANISHING blocks, Mario will often find himself stripped of his new FLUDD device, facing infinitely complex platform puzzles to navigate with just his jumping abilities (which of course include wall-kicks, backflips, twirls and triple jumps).  These unexpected throwbacks with their new amazingly difficult incarnations will leave you constantly changing your camera angle as you fight to balance yourself on a rotating beam or hang on just long enough to the dissolving blocks to see your goal narrowly escape you.\nWith so much to do and such a brilliantly constructed world to view it in, Mario Sunshine provides endless hours of fun and amazement for any video gamer.

I also apparently went to see it with my class at a little theater somewhere, but my recollection of this is extremely vague and, as you can probably tell, didn't impress me much. Of course, in high school there is so much drama and not enough time to really appreciate classic works, and I also don't think I was mature enough to really understand anything going on within the text--nor did I care.\n\nBut that was then, and this is now. Over the holiday this year, I read Hamlet, thinking it was my first time ever, in preparation to teach it. I picked up a free copy for my Kindle and, in order to get the \"play\" experience, had my Kindle read it aloud to me as I followed along in my Folgers' hardcover, annotating the text as I went. This isn't very much fun, for those of you who haven't tried it--don't. But I did come across some very good stuff to talk about in class, such as the question of whether or not Hamlet was faking crazy, or really crazy, the treatment of women, etc... classic questions people have been analyzing for the last 400 years. But nothing really sunk in for me.\n\nThen I went to school and began reading it aloud with my students. While I still think that actually seeing it performed would be the best way to learn and appreciate Shakespeare, I found that reading the text (two more times) aloud in class, listening to student questions, and asking some of my own, taught me a whole lot more about the text, and actually learned to enjoy it as well. Imagine that. I hope my students took away as much as I did from our class discussions...\n\nOverall, I really like Hamlet. Yes, I walked into it griping and putting it off as long as possible--I really don't like reading Shakespeare, only watching it--but it's such a well written, cryptic play! Yes, the language is difficult and it really helps to have a version with translations, but it's so well put together, with sonnets, soliloquies, murder, mayhem, saucy jokes... it's just a great tragedy that I recommend others read, if they haven't done so already. The characterization is superb, and though fictional, Shakespeare really knew his characters and where he wanted them to go. I wish he had written some novels as well... I bet those would be superb!", "This is a fabulous and funny musical tribute to Sesame Street.  It is a great variety show (a la Muppet Show) which is a plus.

I particularly like DA because it is safe to eat, and I take a tablespoon twice a day for old age splotches.  The DA doesn't seem to work that well on millipedes but the sprayer does well to put out a coating to the thickness or density you desire.  For bugs on leaves, the sprayer can apply on top or under the leaves.  If you need to apply a powder, this is better than any DIY device I've found and it is quite inexpensive. Some people complain about the squeak of the plastic while pumping. I couldn't care less, just as long as it does what it is supposed to do.

He left too soon, and didn't get enough accolades in his lifetime. A severely underrated singer/writer, even though Addicted To Love/Riptide and Powerstation were massive successes. His entire catalogue is worth purchasing, often times each album is completely different than the last, and he always made wise choices when it came to cover material. And musicians.\n\nWith 1980's 'Clues' Palmer went down a synthesiser, new wave path that rendered some truly great material, particularly ''Looking For Clues'' and ''Johnny and Mary'', and also teamed him with Gary Numan. But with 1983's Pride, Palmer did an amazing thing. He made an almost totally electronic/synth laden album sound warm and inviting. It's not that he was doing something completely different than The System were writing when they came up with You Are In My System. But his version of their song is a completely different piece of music. Though retaining the main hook of the song that made it great, he adds an amazing amount of personal touches that made Palmer, the producer/arranger/composer, stand out. At least to me it did. I own both versions of this song, by The System and by Robert Palmer. And Palmer took that song and made it his own, and somehow made it 50x better than the original.\n\nIf that was the single track making it worth purchase, I'd stop there. But it's not. This album is truly incredible, and full of great songs, one after the other. The album flows from one song to the next, and one of my favourite moments is ''Want You More'' into ''Dance For Me''. The album has some serious funk on it, touches of Reggae, Calypso, Rock, Arabic and certainly some strangeness. There are touches of the bizarre here on this album ,particularly in the harmony vocal departments. ''Say You Will'' being one of those.\n\n''Say You Will'' has the title repeatedly sung like it's ... well, hard to describe. It's almost threatening the way it's hammered across. But then you have Palmer's beautiful falsetto singing 'Please surrender' over this juggernaut chant, and then the lead vocal snakes in. It's just an incredible song. The music jumps about, it's literally ''jerky''. The album is full of moments like this. Completely different types of music juxtaposed against eachother to turn into some hybrid beast of an album.\n\nPalmer also does a stellar cover of Kool & The Gang's ''You Can Have It (Take My Heart)'', which is just as good as the original. It doesn't vary much from what the original sounded like, but it was such a catchy song to begin with, I imagine Palmer saw no need to mess with its structure. But what he does with the vocal is fantastic. It's once again where Palmer turns the song into his own that makes Pride truly an album worth having.\n\n''Dance For Me'' probably has my favourite Palmer vocal from Pride. Truly a person gifted in voice, Palmer could make a melody line move. He knew when to hold back, and when to let go, and ''Dance For Me'' has many a moment illustrating his sensibilities as a soul vocalist. He's one of the few Caucasian singers I can think of that actually understood Soul. A lot sing it, but few get it. And Palmer got it. And I never felt like he was faking it either. He seemed to have a massive appreciation for R & B, Soul and African American artists, and Pride is an album full of this influence. If you've ever heard his version of Andy Fraser's ''Every Kinda People'' , then you'd know that Palmer had a great degree of Soul, even if it was well-tailored.\n\nBut with Pride, out came this elastic, synthsoul, just at the experimental edge of Palmer that makes this album a work of pure beauty. It's an amazing album. I've played it for 22 years, and it has never lost its veneer. It's actually gotten better with time.\n\nTry and find Robert Palmer's Pride. It is one of those albums I will never be without. I'd like it to turn into that album for you as well.", "Excellent quality & warmth. as for sizing originally order the size 40 for my husband who is 511 and 190lbs .

The description provided here suggests it as a stove for backpacking, but this would be a ridiculous item to take backpacking.  There are much more compact & lightweight stoves to use for backpacking than this one.\n\nI've used Coleman stoves my entire life.  We had them when I was a kid in the 1960s too.  Nope, it's not the same quality it was then.  It's now made from cheap metal, and the folding lid that forms the case is not going to survive decades of use.  I doubt that the guts of the thing will either.  At the same time, nobody else is making an affordable stove that is any better.  So, I guess we're stuck with crappy goods to choose from.  We'll move on from there, since we don't have to beat THAT dead horse.\n\nThis is a very cost effective solution for car camping, tailgating, emergencies at home, and patio cooking.  I use ours exclusively with a refillable propane cylinder, so all of my experiences are based on that experience.  I like to move the bulk of our cooking outdoors in summer to keep the heat out of the house.  It's hot here, and not having that additional source of heat indoors just makes sense to me.  While I would love to have a dedicated summer kitchen with screens, our budget hasn't gone there yet, so I needed a more portable & adaptable solution.  I also do some canning, in small batches, which anyone can tell you is a hot & steamy process!\n\nI had looked at the higher btu stoves, by Camp Chef & other manufacturers.  They are a lot more expensive, and somewhat a PIA to pack up and take camping due to their bulk & more complicated set up process.  Canners love them because of that high btu output and their ability to manage very large canners & pressure cookers.  They also work great for cooking large quantities of food.  The problem was that I wanted a multi-purpose stove for cooking for 2 people, camping, and canning...all in one.\n\nThis was my compromise.  Sure, it does take longer to bring a huge water bath canner to temperature (about an hour with near boiling water & 7 quart jars of product).  At the same time, I can cook eggs & pancakes on it, fry burgers, make mashed potatoes (or whatever) without worrying about scorching everything.  It's easy to pack up for camping or storage, and easy to set up to use.  On a sturdy table, it works well with either a canner OR the pressure cooker, and I can also use a smaller pan to cook something on the second burner.\n\nOther reviews have complained about the burners being impossible to turn down.  Mine were dreadful at first, but with continued frequent use, have become easier to turn down fairly low.  The only thing that they simply are not going to do is turn down to an actual simmer.  To solve this, I would suggest a flame tamer, also available from Amazon.  They are light, easy to pack up, and work well with any gas burner.\n\nI've used it to cook everything under the sun from steaks to French toast.  I've canned pickles and preserves on it.  I've boiled potatoes on it.  You name it, I've done it on that stove.  It has been one of the best purchases we have made in the past year for all purpose camping gear that doubles duty at home.  We use it more than we use our lounge chairs!\n\nFor storage, we've been using the cardboard box it came in.  Obviously, that is not a great long term storage idea.  Unfortunately, I have not figured out which bag would fit it, nor was the Coleman website any help.  Apparently, this is an orphan model.  So, either we'll make a case from wood or sew one from fabric to protect the stove when not in use or for traveling.\n\nOverall, this is a great stove and a very cost-effective solution to provide alternative cooking methods at home, whether for seasonal use, entertaining or emergencies.  It's a great stove for car camping too.  It's much more economical to use with a refillable tank, and it works better in cold weather than the butane stoves I've also got (you know the ones, they come in a plastic \"suitcase\" and use hair spray size cans of butane.)  Just add a supply hose designed for it, a flame tamer if you like to simmer, and a propane \"tree\" if you are using multiple propane appliances off of the single large tank, and you will be completely outfitted!  We also have the stovetop Coleman \"oven\", which works great with this stove, as well as a propane Pizzaque (which makes fantastic pizza & biscuits btw), so a tree is on our shopping list.", "My kids love this game!", "Arnold's performance embodied everything he's about - looking tough, lots of action, and best of all: He is the hero & nobody can stop him!", "RT @MN2NOVA: Love ios5 Easter eggs.

The groove that Frankie Bello and Charlie Benante fix here is the same as any other time...just plain solid, and Scott Ian's multi-tracked guitar riffs are tight as always.\n\nI liked Belladonna as a singer, though it is obvious his range and style are very different from Neil Turban or Jon Bush.

Back in the late 90's, I was obssessed with Spielberg's sci-fi classic, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I admired the \"brilliant\" UFO designs, and the stunning performance of Richard Dreyfuss. Now, I can see that this film hasn't experienced any wear and tear, except maybe the commercial products that were used in the film. The special effects are still mesmerizing, the characters are still engaging, and even though I'm a fan of John Williams, the otherworldly music is still spectacular. Francois Truffaut steals the show as Claude Lacombe, but Dreyfuss is also worthy of mention. He plays Roy Neary, a man who has just had a \"close encounter\" with a trio of unidentified flying objects, and is becoming increasingly obssessive with a mountain-like shape that he seems to see in everyday objects. He should have won the oscar for this film, instead of \"The Goodbye Girl.\"\n\nThank goodness that Star Wars, which was released in theaters in the same year, didn't overshadow this arguably important sci-fi film.

Sure enough, Ricciarelli struggles with the high c-s a couple of times (quite obviously) but she is always dramatically involved. One quickly forgets those moments of her vocal inadequacy because of the dense atmosphere and exotic orchestral magic Karajan and the VPO conjure up in this recording. In fact I think this is one of Karajan's most inspired interpretations of any work he recorded. If one compares Karajan's version of this opera to Mehta's there is absolutely no question which one is the winner. Mehta's conducting is utterly generic by comparison to the spellbinding performance Karajan draws from the VPO in this recording. The sound quality is also significantly better here. Finally, Domingo delivers a solid performance as Calaf and Hendricks fits the role of Liu very well. Raimondi is excellent as Timur.

That's what got me into Laura Nyro, that simple description.  Having bought the album earlier this year and finally gotten around to listening it, I was stunned at how Nyro's vocals fit sassy Motown numbers like velvet.  Gonna Take A Miracle is her and LaBelle, i.e. Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx, and Sarah Dash, doing Motown and other R&B covers, and they do them splendidly.  This is an example of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's production, soon to gain them fame in the Philly Sound.  Laura and her new friends simply jam on the danceable songs, clearly enjoying themselves.\n\nThere are three Martha and the Vandellas songs done here.  The first is \"Dancing In the Street,\" which is the second part of a medley, the first part being the Curtis Mayfield-penned and (I believe) sung by Major Lance.  Both parts have piano (by Nyro) and a percussion section that simply jams.  Their repeated \"don't forget the Motor city\" attests to their influences.  The other is \"Jimmy Mack\" which has a snappy pop/soul sound complete with clapping.  Sheena Easton's did a version with similar tempo in 1986.  And last up is \"Nowhere To Run,\" which has the same jamming sound as \"Dancing In The Street.\"\n\nThey do an acapella version of the Shirelles' \"I Met Him On A Sunday\"  before doing the Originals \"The Bells,\" their soaring harmonies doing great justice. Their cover of Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' \"You Really Got A Hold On Me\" gives the original a run for its money from the sassy uptempo rhythm and harmonies that suddenly springs up after the leisure part.  I thought the Beatles' cover of it was great, but now, looks like I have to give this cover more consideration.\n\nLaura's voice has never been more splendid than on the ballads, which include the title track, originally done by the Royalettes, a piano ballad sweetened by strings and the harmonies of LaBelle, and \"Desiree,\" originally done by the Charts, with ringing vibes accompanying Nyro's resounding vocals.  And a backing brass section helps them out on their cover of Ben E. King's \"Spanish Harlem.\"\n\nThe four bonus tracks are done live by her solo and include Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's \"Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing,\" of which she sings a snatch of before seguing into \"You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman.\"  It looks like I found the definitive interpreter of this song-sorry Aretha and Carole King.

Carr died from cancer while the band recorded the album with Eric Singer- who does a great job filling in and would become the bands official drummer before Carr's death and album's release.\n\nThe last song, \"Carr Jam 1981\", was a good tribute to one of the best drummers in rock history.

Everything the other reviewers say is true, including Steve Albini himself.  This CD is, in a word, perfect.\n\nI will say this:  Spiderland affected producer Steve Albini so deeply, he formed another one of his \"crazy, self-indulgent\" bands and based it primarily on the foundation of Slint's sound.  He called this new band SHELLAC.  Shellac's first CD, \"At Action Park,\" almost sounds like Spiderland part II, (\"Bosche's dick\" is a song about Slint's sound guy; they also had help from Slint techy Jennifer Hartman) as Steve and his band mates recreate and nearly pick-up where Slint left off after their 1992 break up.\n\nShellac (and other bands like it) are influenced so deeply by Slint, their recordings almost sounds like an homage.  But don't call Shellac posers or copy-cats; the members of Slint were playing hard core and punk in the mid-80's, as was Steve Albini and his bands Big Black and Rapeman (which coincidentally included Jesus Lizard's bass player in its line-up).

Matthew 14: 25 - 31 provides a lyrical backdrop: Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the [Sea of Galilee]. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. Its a ghost, they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: Take courage! It is I. Dont be afraid. Lord, if its you, Peter replied, tell me to come to you on the water.\nCome, he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, Lord, save me! Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. You of little faith, he said, why did you doubt? (NIV). It is this fear of the unkown - the deep, dark waters - that terrrified Peter, and it is this fear of the unknown that we confront as we face our own mortality. We must step out onto the water in faith, having not seen our Lord and Savior, but trusting him with our eternal souls.

Let me tell you, I could feel this 'working' on my face right away, and I don't normally classify my skin as 'sensitive'. Oh yeah, 'tingling' is putting it mildly, but it never crossed over to uncomfortable or burning. Let's just say I'll stick to their 'sensitive' line and not try their regular peel... The product has a scent to it, not sure I'd call it 'fruity' but definitely organic - you can tell they don't dump a bunch of perfume in there to try to mask it, which is nice. It's not a bad scent, it almost seems yeasty. After about ten minutes, I rinsed the stuff off, which came off easily, and my skin felt good, not too tight, no more tingles, and it soaked up the moisturizer.\n\nSo far, it's looked good since using the product. Will keep using it and expect to see good results - the box/bottle says to use no more than twice a week, which I believe since it seems potent enough. For the price and the effects you get, Juice Beauty Green Apple Peel is definitely worth the investment.", "Overall this is a pretty good watch.

As far as I can tell, the one-piece band is not adjustable. I have the Casio Illuminator (in silver) that is nearly identical to this one and that watch has an adjustable band. For that reason, I will likely save up and buy a gold one.\n-The green tint of the screen has a prominent, reflective property that I think overtakes the gold when in bright light.\n\nThe silver Casio Illuminator is comparably priced to the gold & silver models of this Timex. The adjustable band and color-neutral screen of the Casio make it a better watch, in my opinion.

Although it states you can apply without doing so, I really feel like it does need to be warmed/worked up prior to applying which is easy enough done on the back of my hand or palm.

A lot of the time, though, you engage in Teken-like fights where you have to rely entirely on your fighting skills to succeed and move on. By pressing a series of different buttons you can execute a huge array of different moves, just like in Teken.\n\nIf you're becoming bored with your mission, you can sidetrack and do other things like collect toys, play in the arcade, listen to your walkman, etc...!!! And it's this, among other things, which add's a glorious feel of realism to the game. All in all, the experience of this game is so potent that you will find no need to visit Japan at all, for this is Japan. There are hundreds of different elements that add to the realism of being in Japan: The friendly neighbours. The corner shops.  The vending machines. The toy machines. The beautiful Japanese architecture. The arcades. The buses. The peaceful tranquility of the place. It's a small, spordically populated Japanese town, which I could easily be convinced actually exists (it probably does exist actually). I love getting up in the morning and occasionally discovering snow outside. I love the crowded streets in the day time and the isolated disquiet at night. I love the way people's attitudes change as you progress through the the weeks, months, seasons. I love getting up in the morning and going to bed at night. It really is like a really exciting version of real life.\n\nThe genius of Shenmue lies in it's ability to merge two worlds together: The mundane and the extraordinary! I've reviewed a lot of games that could arguably be called the greatest game ever, but if I were made to make choice, I'd probably choose Shenmue simply for it's uniqueness.", "I'm using it in my no-dry-ice TEC Peltier electronically cooled \"Nuclear Cloud Chamber\".\n\nThis is creating a seal between the cold plate (which is sitting on top of two Peltier cooler tiles) and a big old wine goblet. All of that sits on top of an Cooler Master 212X dual fan computer CPU cooler. Most of the aforementioned pieces are coupled with thermal paste. Power will come from an ATX computer powersupply I made into a bench top power unit. All of this is going on my 'Science & Optics' blogger...for no real reason other than I have more fun doing this than shoveling snow or mowing the lawn.\n\nThe wine goblet is filled with 99% isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol which gets supercooled and turns into a fog in the the glass goblet. Then you can see alpha, beta, gamma and muon tracks zipping through the fog: visible radiation! I have various radioactive sample sources, plus if you put no radioactive stuff in the chamber every 3 or 3 minutes you'll see a particle zing through and that'll be the result of a cosmic ray interaction: a muon!\n\nMy other nuclear cloud chamber is MUCH simpler: an upside down aquarium resting on a metal plate that sits on top of a block of dry ice. I want to eventually bring this into work (I'm a librarian) and while the radioactive stuff is safe (unless you swallow it) the dry ice is just annoying to deal with after the awesomeness of it gets old: it's cold, melts (well, sublimates), will explode any container it gets sealed it, burns, little kids want to touch it...all not so great for a science demonstration. Plus the only place that sells it is the Walmart that's like 15 minute drive. With this design I just plug it into a wall outlet and dump in a little rubbing alcohol: bam! Coldness.\n\nAnyway, this rubber was REAL rubber. Good feel and that new car tire smell. I was able to easily cut it with a pair of scissors.\n\nThe sheet was really \"floppy\" and could conform to curves if needed. You could easily roll this up and line the inside of a coffee mug or something. Not sure why you'd want to do that, but it'd take zero effort: nice and bendy.\n\nThe only bad thing was that at the center of one edge was a retail hanger tag, the kind with the hole in it to hang off of metal rods in a store. It was STAPLED to the rubber sheet. Just a regular old small staple, and for my purposes it made no difference. Even if I were pulling a strong vacuum (which I'm not) the two staple holes would probably seal themselves up, plus they're at the extreme edge so it wouldn't matter anyway.\n\nWell, that's about all the comments I can muster on a boring old piece of rubber, lol.\n\nMichael Logusz", "Kind of industrial looking on the back of my Subaru Forester, but I wanted something \"beefier\" than the basic strip.

Why? Because any album that is hated by so many for some of the most ridiculous reasons can't be all that bad. As one who owns a copy of each of Bob Dylan's albums from the first self-titled album to the current \"Tempest\", \"Self Portrait\" along with its predecessors \"John Wesley Harding\" & \"Nashville Skyline\" & especially its follow-up \"New Morning\" are favorites I never tire of. Another reason I like Bob Dylan & \"Self Portrait\" is he is not afraid to try different directions & challenge his audience. Whatever ridiculous \"conspiracy theory\" one might choose to \"read into\" the reason for the release of \"Self Portrait\" I think it is very simple. He didn't want to continue to re-record his most influential work over & over & just slap a new dust jacket & name on it. I really like Bob Dylan & his music for the same reason I really like the music of to name a few, Jeff Beck, John McLaughlin, Miles Davis, The Kinks, Fleetwood Mac, Jethro Tull, U2, Bill Connors, Steve Winwood, Genesis & John Coltrane. None of these artists got or get stagnant, aren't or weren't afraid to challenge their audience, & continue(d) to grow musically. How many could have predicted The Kinks that recorded \"All Day & All Of The Night\" would go onto to record \"Celluloid Heroes\"? Fleetwood Mac went from a hard rocking Chicago-styled blues-rock band featuring a three lead guitar/frontman with rhythm section line-up to a smooth, slick (sometimes too slick) top forty chick-rock band. My sister is a fan of the Buckingham-Nicks Fleetwood Mac lineup & she heard me playing a cd of Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac's late '60s blues-rock. She didn't believe me when I said it was Fleetwood Mac when she asked me what on earth I was listening to. Most music fans aren't aware the Fleetwood Mac that existed from 1968 to 1974 even existed. Fleetwood Mac's best material (my opinion) came from that time period & yet you NEVER hear it on commercial rock radio, especially \"classic rock\" radio. Miles Davis pioneered be-bop jazz in the '50s & early '60s, then went on to forge jazz-rock aka fusion in the late '60s & through the early '70s. He received even more derision for that than Bob Dylan received for \"Self Portrait\". John McLaughlin has played just about every conceivable style of music on both the acoustic & electric guitar, including an Indian/jazz hybrid. Jeff Beck is another who has done it all on his instrument & isn't afraid to try new things. What all of this boils down to is \"Self Portrait\" is hated & loathed because it wasn't what most had gotten used to & expected. Bob Dylan has released how many albums? If I wanted to hear \"Highway 61 Revisited\" or \"Blonde On Blonde\" ad infinitem through 40 or 50 some albums why would I buy the same album recorded over & over again? I would only have to buy it once. For those who like the same album repackaged over & over again please refer to AC/DC, Kiss, Bad Company, Slayer, The Eagles, or Aerosmith to name a few. \"Self Portrait\" is not perfect, but I would much rather hear an honestly made album that stands out in a large catalog than one that just blends in with all the others because there is no variety in the artist's catalog (AC/DC & Kiss have perfected this to the extreme). I recommend Bob Dylan's \"Self Portrait\" ONLY to those who aren't afraid to hear something different or not expected from a pioneering artist. You won't waste your money here. All others who want to hear only what \"classic rock\" radio & the music press think you should hear, stay away! You won't be able to handle this!

I'd still be using it if the sensors hadn't worn out from age, use and dust.\n\nThis trackman was stiff to use and I had to keep shifting my hand to hit the buttons. It did not install easily and would not connect using the ps2 adaptor so I was forced to use the usb connector and for some reason that caused issues with activesync so that every time I put my pda in it's docking station - the cursor would freeze.  Trying to get some real support from Logitech was a joke.  I finally had enough after 4 days of this and went to a big box electronic store and ended up buying a Microsoft Optical Trackman Explorer.

Sadly, it was a poor choice. I own the original Rogue Squadron and I really enjoy the game, so I figured this would be a great first rental. Right from the start though, I was disappointed.\nThe game starts with corny dancing Stormtroopers to some old time music holding up yellow squares to form the Lucas logo or something. Whaa? That kinda breaks the mood... but forgivable. Then I got to the menu screen... scenes from the movies played randomly in the background serving no apparent purpose, except maybe to give the developers less original work to do.\nWhen I finally got in game, being new to the Gamecube, I hit the training mission. I figured I'd learn about all the cool abilities of the various crafts and how to best fight the Empire. Instead, I'm \"treated\" to a empty field with random training icons floating. Most are completely useless, such as \"press A to fire... Good Job!!\" A few are truly retarted... \"You found a Jabba's Palace... GOOD JOB!!\". If I had that computer tell me 'good job' just one more time... I would have thrown my controller down right then and there. So, annoyed, I quit and headed for the first mission...\nWithout any good explanation or reason, I'm suddenly fighting above the Death Star. Lasers are shooting everywhere, tie's are flying in every possible direction, and my wingmen are screaming at me for leadership. I liked it. I quickly pull up the targeting computer and take down a few ties. Then I order my wingmen to do the same, and set upon the mission's goals. It was a great mission, but random.\nNext mission, I'm in an asteroid field. How on earth did I get here? No... never mind... it looks gorgeous, who cares. I'm blasting stuff, having a unconvinced but good time. Sadly, this doesn't last until mission 3. By mission 3 I'm bored, the gorgeous graphics die down to just standard locations, and the missions are very tedious. By the later levels, it was so easy to mess up a small detail and have to start over I said forget it, no more.\nThis game starts off with a major blast (if you avoid the training) and dies quickly from there. It doesn't get better, it just keeps going instead. If you can find it cheap, rent it for the first few levels alone. It'll be fun for a few days.

Returned.", "First of all, everyone buying this should be clear, this game is not a flight sim. Jane's WWII Fighters for example, was a WWII combat flight sim. This is nothing like that in spite of some other comments here in Amazon reviews. There is no attempt at realism, it is an arcade game with in-flight \"repairs\" (health restoration) and other arcade features. There are no gauges for air speed and altitude, no artificial horizon none of that.\n\nSo the question becomes, is this a good arcade game. I love flying games in general, be they arcade or flight sims, but I can't say I love this one. For the $19.99 currently being charged, it's not bad, but if you paid $50 for this a few months ago then there are probably some game owners out there with some regrets. It's definitely not worth $50.\n\nFirst of all, the control scheme allows for many setups, but all of them can be difficult to master since any flight game, even an arcade flying game, works best of all with a joystick, a \"real\" joystick, not the little thumb-operated thing on the nunchuk. While one of the simulation modes allows for the tiny joystick to be operated like the joystick flight stick control in a flight sim, fine manoeuvres with just your thumb on the tiny stick can be difficult to master. Nevertheless, this is probably the best setup. Wii remote controls can be wonderful for some games and terrible for others. I don't believe that Wii controls generally work well for flying games and this one is no exception. Some people will find the controls okay, while others will find them near impossible to master. It can be very difficult to finely manoeuvre your aircraft in three dimensions with just your thumb.\n\nSecond, the dialog during the campaign and arcade type quick missions is truly terrible. After an hour of playing the game it was literally driving me crazy so I turned the sound on the voices down to make them inaudible. That at least is a feature I really appreciated, being able to turn the voices off.\n\nThird, some of the missions can be difficult simply because it's unclear what exactly is supposed to be done to accomplish them. This can lead to frustration.\n\nFourth, missions cannot be saved in mid-mission. While there are checkpoints during missions that allow you to start again from a completed checkpoint, this only applies while the game is currently running. If you back out of the game or turn off the console, you will have to fly the entire mission over again to complete it. Arrggh!\n\nFifth, the one good point of the game is the large number of planes to be unlocked as there are more than 40. However, differences between them are strictly related to things like how much damage they take, speed, firepower, etc. While these would matter in a flight sim as well, there are no real differences between the planes that one would find in a sim, such as ceiling, turning radius, etc. Unlocking planes can be tricky though, because some of the missions are quite difficult to figure out or complete.\n\nThis game is just okay and I only recommend it if you like arcade style flying games and you can buy it at no more than $20.", "Grandma bought this for our 6 month old daughter.

That is unacceptable for a professional product.\n\nHosa makes many cables and other products for professional or semi-professional audio applications. Their cables generally offer good value for money and hold up for years of use. They are ubiquitous in professional audio settings. This item is one stereo pair of RCA cables for unbalanced analog audio signals. Common uses for this cable are to connect consumer-grade CD/DVD players, karaoke machines, cassette decks, computer audio interfaces, or other devices to a mixer with RCA inputs. Generally, higher-end professional CD/DVD players, karaoke machines, and computer audio interfaces offer XLR or 1/4-inch TRS connections, which are not compatible with this cable.\n\nThis cable also uses injection-molded connectors, which are common on consumer-grade cables. True professional cables typically uses soldered component connectors, such as cables by Canare or Mogami (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/5-Foot-RCA-Cable-Pair-Made-with-Canare-L-4E6S-Star-Quad-Audio-Interconnect-Cable-and-Neutrik-Rean-NYS-Gold-RCA-Connectors-High-End-Directional-topography-for-superior-noise-rejection-and-audiophile-grade-performance-characteristics-2-cables-each-cable-is-5-feet-long-for-left-and-right-channels/dp/B0105Q4YL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">5 Foot RCA Cable Pair - Made with Canare L-4E6S, Star Quad, Audio Interconnect Cable and Neutrik-Rean NYS Gold RCA Connectors - High-End Directional topography for superior noise rejection and audiophile-grade performance characteristics (2 cables, each cable is 5 feet long, for left and right channels)</a>). Those cables are much more costly and typically made-to-order by a professional audio supplier. Although I frequently use injection-molded cables in budget-limited applications, they do not offer the physical durability or audio quality as professional cables. When I received the two pairs of Hosa RCA cables I ordered, one was defective out of the box. Using a resistance meter, the center (hot) contact of one side (color) was broken, it did not carry signal. This makes me leery of the quality of the connections in Hosa's injection-molded cables, such as this one. If a connector left the factory broken or broke during shipping, I cannot be sure that one won't fail during an event. That would be an embarrassing mishap, especially if there was not a spare on hand or the changeout took a long time. Therefore I would not buy Hosa cables again.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure anything has improved since then. The people who have been working on this the longest  people like the lawyer Talila Lewis and the organization HEARD and artist and activist Leroy Moore  remain unfunded  even as organizations pour money into trainings for cops. But police don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need training to choose not to shoot folks like Sanchez. They just have to stop treating noncompliance as a justification for escalation.\nBack to  Sanchez   we see similar patterns of police conduct  this time with horrible  lethal  consequences. Sara Novi\u00c4\u0087  who identifies as Deaf and is an assistant professor of creative writing at Stockton University  told me via e-mail that the killing emerged from a \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect storm of communication anxiety for many d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to talk to strangers  especially when the stakes are high. It was also dark. She notes  \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven the most skilled deaf communicators/lipreaders struggle in the dark. It is only natural that  Sanchez  would try to get closer so  he  could see what was going on  especially because  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099d had no involvement in the traffic incident they were investigating.  He  was sitting on  his  porch minding  his  own business;  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099d done nothing wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But  he  didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094comply with orders  so a police officer killed  him .\n Instead of training police to grant people they recognize as disabled specific rights  victims like Leibel and Sanchez  demonstrate the need for police to operate with a baseline of presumption of compliance. When significant threats emerge  as does tragically happen  officers will need to respond. But when  Sanchez  walked forward  surely the officers could have stepped back. When the autistic boy was shaking his string  the officer could have just decided not to cuff a child  even if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognize the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cstimming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There are so many ways to improve the situation without asking for specialized training.\nAt least four disabled people died at the hands of police this week. One previous case of unjustified police violence came to light. Except for the brief media attention of the Sanchez and Leibel cases  that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty normal week. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely anyone will be held accountable  except possibly in the situation where Leibel  a white teenager in an affluent neighborhood  was brutalized. There  the combination of powerful video  a compelling victim  widespread coverage  and a good lawyer might help. In the other cases  the multiply marginalized status of the victims plus the lethality of the encounter will make accountability difficult  if not impossible.

I sent an email to the seller requesting a refund and an RMA to send the 2 screen protectors back that didn't fit my phone.  At first I was informed that I couldn't request a refund after 30 days.  I informed the seller that I did in fact request a refund on the first wrong screen protector that was sent to me and that I would be escalating this issue with an Amazon representative.  I was informed that I would receive a refund which I did receive with no request to send the 2 screen protectors back that I can't use.  So I have 2 screen protectors that don't fit my phone and I am still without a screen protector.  I have read some fairly good reviews of the Skinomi screen protector for the SGS2 Skyrocket but I don't want to try and order another one from this seller because of the frustration I dealt with trying to get the correct screen protector the first time.", "2 hours to get home cause of this flooding while having to walk through waist high water to get home 3 times and to save some guys car", "caused damage to my fuel pump", "Jade left me all alone\ud83d\ude2d http://t.co/tykkTUjZox", "I'm curious as to how the seller can say velcro like, when the only part of this little \"kit\" that is velcro, is on the backing pad.

It worked well at first but it must be wearing out. I don't use it all that much either. I can no longer get the wheels in plane. The cut drifts quite a lot on re-sawing anything more than 3\" high. I have spent hours attempting to make it right again. The guide bearings need constant adjustment. Every cut requires several test cuts and adjustments. CRAP!\nToo bad, it's the only Grizzly tool I own that has any real issue. My table saw is 5 years old and has been the workhorse of my shop. I just checked for blade runout for the first time in a year. There was none.\n\nI will be purchasing a new Rikon model 10-325 14\" bandsaw from Woodcraft. All the reviews are very good. They have it for $699 this month. With tax, that's $748. Would cost $829 to have shippped but I live 10 miles from a WC store. Amazon will sell for $744 with free shipping but it's easier to return to the brick and morter if I have to.\n\nUpdate:\nThe trunions are kinda cheap aluminium. They are held by bolts. After re-adjusting the table several times, the bolt washers were cutting up the trunions. I replaced the bolts with studs and nuts. much easier to adjust.\nI have resawed lots of cherry to make bookmatched door panels. I would buy this saw again but I would prefer cast trunions for more strenght and stability.\n\nI have a Grizzly table saw, Grizzly 2 hp chip and dust collector, Grizzly baby drum sander, and a Grizzly miter saw stand. They all work flawlessly. My jointer is a Jet and my planer and miter saw are DeWalt.\nSince this is my first bandsaw, I have nothing to compare against.\nOut of the box and assembled, it ran fairly smooth but had some vibration. The setup was fairly easy except for getting the table parallel to the blade. I gave up on that for now. The practice blade cut ok for crosscutting. Ripping wood caused the blade to wander slightly. Resawing wandered a bit also. But not bad for a cheapo blade.\nSince I purchased the riser block and upgraded resaw fence, I decided to get it all installed and work from there. The first issue was with the riser block. The pins were out of allignment with the bottom of the block. I filed them to make it work. I attempted to set things up and noticed the wheels were out of plane considerably. I started the moter. It vibrated more than a vegas bed. I attempted to resaw. Disaster. The blade tracked so much it almost broke. Shimming the bottom wheel out would be an exercise in futility. Hmmm, the riser block! I removed the block and cut off the bottom pins with a hacksaw. Took about 30 seconds. Replaced the block and rather heavy and awkward top. Used a wood clamp to hold it on while I popped in the bolt. Tapped the whole top unit over about 1/4\" or so to bring the wheels into coplane to within 1/32\" or so. Tracked the blade, set the blade guides and decided to try a little resawing on some cherry. The blade still tracked badly and it started to smoke. It was ruined. I then purchased a 3/4\" wood slicer, set up everything by the book, and did some more resawing. Sliced like butter! Still a bit of vibration. The rubber tires had some flat spots. Replaced with orange urethane tires. $25 for a set of 2 from Rockler. Best price on the net. Vibration all but disappeared.\nThe saw is solidly built, has a strong motor, and options that much higher priced saws have. The stand is very sturdy and rolls around nicely with the addition of some 2\" wheels. The fit and finish are not nearly as nice as the Jet but I didn't buy this saw to drive to car shows. I bought it to resaw hardwoods.\nI expected some setup issues and was not disappointed. Definately worth the time. Would have cost about twice the cash for a comparable jet or delta.\nThis is a nice addition to my shop. Grizzly does it again!", "@united yes lots.

This film has been used in courses on the Holocaust to show how propaganda works: by inducing a state of conformity in the target audience.  I don't think I've ever seen a more dishonest film, or an uglier one.\n\nOf course people who judge films by the effect they have on their moods will disagree.  They don't see the similarity between this effect and say, the effect of...heroin.  If they should happen upon actual art-- which is supposed to help human beings understand the world and how to live in it-- these people would of course reject it as \"weird.\"\n\nThis is industrial propaganda masquerading as \"honesty.\"  Pure evil.\n\nHaving said that,  in the years since this film was released,  Matt Damon has come a long way towards becoming a real artist.

This book doesn't have anything about that, everything happened in Stark's dreams and in the dreams there are no future, present or past.", "The Bushnell Permafocus 12x50s do not show as much detail as a pair of 7x35 binoculars for objects less than 100 yards away because the 12x50s are not in good focus at 100 yards, and uselss at less than 50 yards. Bushnell deserves a \"booo-hisss\" for hiding this information from customers. The minimum usable distance probably varies with the ability of the user's eye to focus (this decreases with age) but mine are probably about average. Also, the inside instructions indicate Permafocus binocs are good at less than 100 ft, depending on the model. This is not true for the 12x50s. Most inexpensive 7x35s will give a better view at 300 feet and less.\n\nBut if objects are over 200 yards, the 12x50s are in focus and flawless as far as i can tell. I can easily recognize people at 700 yards. I can read license plates at 350 yards (it helps if the binoculars are resting on something to prevent vibration).\n\nWithout a support, there's probably too much shaking for 16x50 binocs to do much better than 12x50s.\n\nThe eyepiece rubber does not stay rolled back (if you try to use them with glasses) for more than 1 second, so you can't wear glasses while using them, but as with other binoculars, you do not need to wear your glasses. I don't know the science behind it, but whether or not you wear glasses does not seem to make a difference with the Permafocus. The rubber around the eyepieces cannot be removed unless it's cut.\n\nIn summary, the normal Bushnell 12x50s are probably much better than the Bushnell Permafocus 12x50s because they can be used at much shorter distances and focusing on objects greater than 200 yards should not be too much of a pain. These 12x50s are no good unless your typical viewing distance is greater than 150 yards and you don't plan to use them on less than about 60 yards. I'm returning them due to \"manufacturer's defect\".\n\nBut concerning the Permafocus idea: I love my old pair of \"total focus\" 7x35's for bird-watching and carrying in the car. Being free of focus is a different experience almost as big as going from monocular to binocular. But you need a pair that can focus down to 50 yards.", "It worked really well at first but after around a month now it doesn't turn on or even ignite with another lighter.

That's why most reporters -- those lying, leftist, corporate rightwing apologist, white priveliged, Obama loving professionals -- use reporter notebooks.\n\nThis thing has some good qualities: it is far more durable than a regular reporter notebook, and it has a lot of pages.

I was encouraged by the reviews for this one, and saw that it was an indie release, which I like to support, so I gave it a try. I'm sad to say I couldn't enjoy it, although I really stuck with it, hoping the end would redeem it. Unfortunately, the dynamic between the two main characters - the British Simon and American Aimee who is 'trapped' in his home - really annoyed me. It is supposed to be your classic they-think-they-hate-each-other-but-really-it's-love dynamic, but we don't see enough of their better sides to really care all that much. The writing style put me off as well - they never  become real, fleshed out people. They both just feel like 'roles' rather than individuals. And there is no nuance in their presentation - the author frequently just tells us how they feel rather than allowing it to come out through their words and actions. The plot is completely ridiculous, and while if the characters were more enjoyable I might have been willing to put up with this, since they weren't I just wanted to say 'oh come on, this whole issue can be resolved in 5 minutes flat by doing X.'\n\nI decided to give it 2 stars though - 1 for effort, and 1 for value, as it's a good price.

Please keep this in mind as I review the book.\n\nI've read all of Forester's Hornblower, and Kent's Bolitho; and about half of Stuart's Hazard novels. O'Brian's \"Lucky Jack\" Aubrey suffers badly by comparison. I do not approve of him as an officer; about the only thing he gets right is that you must inspire and not drive the men. But he depends far too much on luck and does far too little planning in his campaigns, and I cannot say that I approve of his personal conduct ashore. When Aubrey is at sea, he does an adequate job of running his ship, but on dry land he lends new meaning to the phrase \"spending money like a sailor on shore leave.\" In my opinion he should not be allowed ashore without a keeper, and never should be allowed more than pocket money. He needs a man of business to handle his prize money, for heaven known he can't. But that is by the way.\n\nWhen I read Forester, Kent, Reeman, Stuart, Gallery, or Griffin I expect action, and I am generally not disappointed. But O'Brian spends FAR too much time on the soap opera aspects of Aubrey and Maturin's lives ashore. I frankly could not care less about their romances, because they fail to advance the plot, as, say, Hornblower's romance with Barbara Wellesley does; or in similar vein, as General Frank Savage's romance with Flight Lieutenant Pamela Mallory does in Twelve O'Clock High. I find that O'Brian gets so bogged down in the non-naval aspects of the novel, that actions such as Aubrey's cutting-out raid in the Polychrest or the strike against the Spanish flotilla in the Lively late in the novel are almost incidental.\n\nIf you like your seafaring adventures with a strong admixture of irrelevant soap opera, you will adore Post Captain, and O'Brian's other works in the Aubrey-Maturin series.

I thought I might even set a world record for \"longest use of a Microsoft product without a major system crash.\"  Unfortunately, this diminuitive little terror was too much for my poor system and it finally gave up the ghost.\nI bought the Netgear MR814 router and two of these MA101 adapters; one for my Win98 system and another for my WinXP system.  I will say the router installed without a hitch.  These things on the other hand are junk, to put it mildly, and the tech support staff were about as helpful as a blindfold.\nFirst off, the Win98 system just could not recognize the device upon startup.  It would show up in the device manager but as disabled.  The only way to get it working was to remove the device, reinstall it, and reconnect to the network every time I started the computer.  Even this process was slow and annoying, taking well over two minutes while the system hangs and tries to figure out what this foreign object is.  Based on the other reviews here, you will note that I'm not the only reviewer that has had this problem.\nTech support?  Well, this can take anywhere from five to forty-five minutes and, assuming you're not hung up on, you might as well start dialing the instant you have problems.  Reason?  Even though I told the techs repeatedly that I've done all the \"basic\" troubleshooting like removing and reinstalling drivers, removing, unplugging, and reinstalling the device, etc... they make you go through the entire process anyway.  After three separate calls, totalling an hour and a half of hold time and another hour and a half of reinstalling things, the best the tech could say was \"reinstall Windows.\"  This is techspeak for \"I have no clue.\"  Against my better judgement, I did it anyway except Windows messed up the reinstall.  One computer dead, one to go.\nI'm \"happy\" to report the WinXP computer did install the device but there was just one slight problem.  It could recognize the network and even saw the router's SSID, but it would not connect to it.  Here we go again.  After two different phone calls, and a lot of inane disconnecting and reconnecting, the best the techs could tell me was it was due to interference.  Strange, considering my other computer could recognize the network fine before meeting its untimely death and it's the same distance from the router.  Again, techspeak for \"I have no clue.\"  Ironically, I did manage to get it to work after I hung up on the tech.  Don't ask me how because I really don't know.\nSo now, after the added expense of a Windows XP \"upgrade\" and the loss of an entire weekend, I have my network set up.  One final problem.  If I try any WEP encryption keys, I will lose the connections on both computers.  I was able to get the router to allow access to these two computers only. Assuming this actually works, that should be secure enough, but I'm still not too keen about all my data passing back and forth unencrypted.\nHopefully this review will convince you to look elsewhere.", "The anti-acne ingredient in Vichy Normaderm Beautifying lotion is 1.5% salicylic acid.

It has always been a better choice than the other options out there, especially since some of those have become fat, sluggish media suites and have forgotten their roots.\n\nNero has also fattened up, but several of its components are still very usable and useful. Why then does this product rate only 1-star?\n\nDespite all of the positive features, and there are many, there is at least one feature that makes this product totally unacceptable with a warning of Do Not Buy. Note that this feature may not apply to everyone, and there are lots of users who will never face this situation. But for those whom it affects, it is a disaster that you will have no control over, and it can utterly destroy your media library.\n\nHere is what happened to me  when I opened the Media Home feature of the software it automatically searched my drive and ALL connected drives and automatically (and without my permission) converted numerous files and resaved them, overwriting my original file. This starts happening immediately, and as a typical user I have no idea what was happening at first. I started poking around in the options menu and learned that the program is set to change file names and formats by default and you have to manually turn that feature off.\n\nSo, in real terms, is this a deal-breaker? Yes. The first time I started Nero Media Home it started searching my attached backup drive and converting irreplaceable media files, some of which I had collected over as long as 15 years, into their acceptable format. Every one of them became a 291kb Nero format file, never to be opened by any other app ever again. So despite Nero advertising that their media player will play anything I tried to open those 291kb files (which is impossibly small to contain audio, video or photo information) and the app informed me that the file could not be opened. That it is corrupted and unusable. And I was left with countless worthless media files.\n\nI immediately uninstalled the entire software suite when I saw what was happening and threw it in the trash. Please understand that you may buy, use and love this app and this may not affect you. Only those of us who have an archive of media files that Nero decides to convert on its own and without permission will consider this software to be unacceptable. If you're not sure, its a big risk to take. Too big!\n\nTo be fair, someone who said they represent Nero responded to my review basically saying what I described is impossible and that I should contact tech support but they didn't give me a service ticket number or escalation contact. However I already ditched the software so thats not much help. I'm surprised at their denial that there's a problem. That type feedback from them seems to be consistent throughout the other 1-star reviews (which seem to have a trend of getting not-helpful votes from \"someone\") while, as others have pointed out, it seems most of the 5-star reviews are only a few words long about how they love the product but those reviews lack any useful details why they love it so much. I did re-write my review to assure my experience is described honestly and accurately, whether Nero chooses to accept that fact or not, and as a previously happy long-time Nero user who has to this point said many positive things about them, I'm disappointed.\n\n[IMPORTANT UPDATE]  after upgrading to WIN10 I thought I would give this software another chance, after all how could they keep selling it if it was so bad? I realize that most people only have a handful of photos, videos and songs on their computers these days and most people won't care if Nero decides to optimize their files. I installed Nero under controlled conditions (I unplugged all of my external drives first and made sure I didn't have anything important on my main hard drive. Sure enough the same thing happened to me as the first time I tested it. As soon as I connected a drive with pictures, videos and songs on it, Nero went to work to optimize them. This time I knew how to stop it before it destroyed everything and I took the time to take screen-shots before I uninstalled Nero (I was using a newer copy of the same version as I previously threw away).  Why would I care if my photos are turned into low-res JPEGs? Well, I purposely work with my files in both RAW and PNG so I can edit multiple layers in a non-destructive mode. Once the files are reduced to low-res JPEGs they are useless to me. Also  I have in excess of 50,000 photos on my hard drives. Nero wants to put them all into an album for me. That works for people who have maybe 100 photos on their computer. The last thing in the world I want is a photo album with 50,000 pictures in it.  BTW, once installed it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove just the MediaHome app by itself, so you cant just keep an app that may be actually useful like the burning ROM app.", "There are two reasons I thought it was a good idea to buy that pump. It was advertised as \"silent\", and it promised \"powerful aeration\". This pump gives out only 4.35psi pressure (on each nozzle, but pressure doesn't add up). I wouldn't call this \"powerful\". Notice how there is no mention of the pressure parameters in the product description. That's not really that important, or that bad, but the noise...

Really, this air pump is louder than my water pump, which is pretty loud all things considered. I'm seriously buying myself a dB level meter just to see what is Rena's definition of \"silent\". I estimate this pump produces at least 30dB of noise. I guess by now I should know better than to buy anything that says silent, but omits the noise level on the box or the technical sheet.

The top is the single most important part of the guitar.  How it vibrates gives the guitar its sound.  Laminates are very stiff, and will not resonate well.  And when they tell you the sound will \"improve with age and playing\"?  If it were solid spruce or ceder, that would be true, but a laminate will sound the same 20 years later.

I read the entire book, just so we're clear. I am also an aspiring writer myself.\nThe grammar and syntax are just fine, which is good because that is not the case in other books I have read. However, the book overall, is terrible.\nThis to me appears to read like the first draft of a novel. It is a good START but it needs significant revamping. I actually really like the story line, the plot idea and I really wanted it to work, and then it ended so abruptly!! As I said, it needs significant development. The story should be twice as long, with much more development of the feelings of affection between the two main characters.\nThe father character is awful and totally flat with unbelievable dialogue.\nThe crooks were also stereotypical and flat and unbelievable.\nThe conflicts and affections between the two main characters is only slightly believable but with some work it could really be developed into a lovely romantic story. I believe the author worked hard on these two characters but ignored the rest, which is unfortunate. In every book, the main characters are of course important, but equally important, are side characters. While developing characters in my romantic book series, I ended up starting entire new books off the stories of the side characters because they do often have their own story to tell!!\nThe ending was abrupt and lacked proper development. I have read other books with similar endings that  worked. There's nothing wrong with the idea of how the story ended, it just lacked development.\nThere were religious undertones throughout, which I appreciated, but those were also very underdeveloped.\nThese words might seem harsh but my hope is that the author reads these words and takes heart, using these criticisms to work more diligently in developing her writing craft.

What happens when the LEAST talented band member becomes the primary creative force? In this case, 50-year-old Mike Love tries to trade off of the band's stereotypical image of teenage summer hedonists to come up with the band's last, and worst, studio album.

I just realized that I missed Pretty Little Liars on Tuesday. :/", "Those who have been using Quicken for any period of time know that upgrades are mandatory, as Intuit starts turning off functionality in older versions as time goes buy.  So every three years or so, I find myself forced to cough up $50 for a piece of software that does substantially the same thing as the previous versions (including all the same bugs).  Quicken 2011 is no different.  Here are the major drawbacks:\n\n1. We continue to be unable to import any file from anyone who has not paid Intuit for the privilege.  Some smaller banks and many 529/401(k) programs do not want to spend their money on this so there is no way to download transactions from those companies directly into the software.  There is not even a simple import format that they could provide for manual import--that has been completed eliminated from the Quicken product.  They should at least provide that so someone could build a spreadsheet for import.  Contrary to Intuit's position, it is not rocket science to build a file with \"Txn Date\", \"Txn Description\", and \"Amount\" line items.\n\n2. The UI unnecessarily provides all its own elements.  That is, it does not use the standard text boxes, toolbars, and so forth built into Windows that you see in a browser form and most other applications.  The result of this is a very slow refresh time every time you switch pages within the product or switch to Quicken from another application, noticeable even on a fast, modern machine.\n\n3. About every six months, an account randomly gets itself out of balance.  TIP:  It is often the very first transaction for the account that has been corrupted--perhaps you started with an opening balance of zero four years ago, and all of a sudden the opening balance is $76.23 or something, so everything is off by that amount.\n\n4. Ads abound.  They are littered across your desktop, your start menu, your program menu, your taskbar, the UI itself.  You cannot even start the application without being asked if you want a Quicken credit card before you can use the program.  I paid for this software--I should not see ANY ads.\n\n5. You are not buying this software, you are renting it.  It will cease working with full functionality in 2014 (or earlier if Intuit's CEO has a bad day at the races).\n\n6. Getting support is very spotty.  Support from Intuit itself generally consists of, \"let's try to uninstall and re-install your software and keep our fingers crossed.  If you have to re-enter 15 years of transactions across 25 accounts afterwards, well, that's too bad\".  You can get support from the Quicken forums, but unfortunately it consists primarily of \"yeah, that happened to me, too--let me know if you solve it\" and bombastic fanboys telling everyone else that it couldn't possibly be Intuit's software causing the problem; it is obviously your fault.\n\nBottom line:  The reality is that the only reason a thinking person buys this software is because there is no viable option, and Intuit knows it, which is why none of this is ever going to change.", "This item comes completely disassembled.

Funny how they spent millions in CA to fight a prop that would make it so they needed to label GMO foods.

The resultant sludge is scraped off the top and allowed to dry. In addition to soy protein it contains free-form excitotoxic amino acids (e.g., MSG) and other potentially harmful chemicals including cancer-causing chemicals in many cases . . .\n\nThe food industry sometimes uses large amount of hydrolyzed proteins as a \"taste enhancer\" because it contains significant amounts of MSG (monosodium glutamate). This is what is known in the food industry as \"Clean Labels\" -- adding MSG to food, without having to list it as \"MSG\" on the label.\n\nIn almost all cases, hydrolyzed soy protein contains a significant amount of genetically-manipulated soy. The hydrolyzed protein products currently added to foods should be considered a detriment to one's health. There are much healthier sources of soy protein and soy nutrients.", "I have tried many \"Miracle easy\" sharpeners. Unfortunately none work as stated.

You shouldnt have to wear yourself out with a tool and your work WILL show poor results and loose rivets are not acceptable.\nWith the pistol grip fype particularly air hydraiulic about 80% of your strength and effort can be concentrated on keeping the rivet flush or even holding two pieces of work together with the other hand.\nSo if you are a gorilla or like to expend extra effort this marson is as good as any but is the same bad tool.\nYou can do better!", "My dog hates it!!

Not only that, this attachment has a capacity of approximately 6 toddler sized handfuls of grass.  Seriously, you can only mow 10 to 15 linear feet before the catcher will not hold anymore without dumping it out (due to the way the catcher fits on the mower), and that is on flat ground - it will not hold anything if the handle bouces up.  The catcher can be modified to work in an almost mediocre fashion if you want to put the time and materials into reworking it, but honestly you would be better off starting from scratch if you were doing this.

But you almost certainly didn\u2019t do that. Perhaps you dipped in a toe in November or December  as the price hit headline-grabbing records\u2014$10 000  then $15 000  then higher. If you were very unlucky and bought at the peak of about $20 000 on Dec. 17  you\u2019d have lost more than 40 percent of your money as of Jan. 16  when the price was $11 200. More than $2 000 of that decline came in about 24 hours  after South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon indicated the country may crack down on cryptocurrency trading to discourage speculation. It\u2019s not every asset that can feel like it\u2019s in a bubble and a crash at the same time.\nBut based on no other valuation metric than what it cost a year ago  the price of  Bitcoin  is still dizzyingly high. For the many doubters who can\u2019t believe things have come this far\u2014and for  Bitcoin  owners who can see how much they might lose\u2014the big question is what it would take to knock the price back further.\nIn past episodes  \u201c Bitcoin  and digital currencies have been incredibly resilient to bad news \u201d says Meltem Demirors  director of development at Digital Currency Group  which invests in  Bitcoin  and related technologies. Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Mt. Gox  Bitfinex  and BTC-e have been hacked over the years  with hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of  Bitcoin  stolen. China in September moved to shut down exchange trading of the cryptocurrency. None of these permanently stopped  Bitcoin \u2019s rise up the price charts  especially after  it  drew the attention of hedge fund traders and futures markets.\nOne doomsday scenario would be a successful hack of the blockchain. That\u2019s the underlying technology that records and verifies every transaction  using exact copies of a database spread on computers all over the world. Those host computers  called miners  are rewarded with new Bitcoin for doing the work of verifying transactions. An attacker might be able to alter the blockchain\u2019s history by marshaling more than half the computing power on the network. But that would be monumentally difficult; someone with the technology to do it could instead \u201copt into the game\u201d and get paid to mine Bitcoin  says Tyler Winklevoss  co-founder of the Gemini digital asset exchange and one of the largest  Bitcoin  holders.\nThe likelier risks are far more pedestrian. The first is that while plenty of investors and speculators have piled into  Bitcoin    it \u2019s a difficult currency to use in the real world. The network is slow and expensive for small transactions. And who wants to spend $4 in  Bitcoin  for a coffee if next week that could be worth $8? \u201cMy big concern as a company is that digital currency doesn\u2019t find its quote-unquote killer use cases  where people are saying  \u2018Wow  we now have tens of millions of daily active users that are using it for payments \u2019 \u201d says Adam White  who runs GDAX  the exchange for institutional investors run by Coinbase. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the largest existential threats to the company.\u201d\nThere\u2019s been a very public civil war among  Bitcoin  developers: One group favors changes to the network  the other doesn\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s got to have the developer community come together and figure out how to scale it properly and continuously \u201d says Sheri Kaiserman  a managing director at Wedbush Securities and an early Wall Street believer in  Bitcoin \u2019s potential. Meanwhile   Bitcoin  faces competition from other digital currencies  from Bitcoin Cash to Litecoin to Ether  which have also seen big gains and wild swings.\nYou could spend weeks learning about the nuances of the various cryptocurrencies. But the main risk to  Bitcoin  is actually the easiest to understand. \u201cThe biggest factor in what\u2019s driving the price up is potentially what will drive it down\u2014a reversal of animal spirits \u201d says Adam Ludwin  chief executive officer of blockchain startup Chain. \u201cThere is essentially a belief this will continue to go up. If people believe it will continue to go down  that\u2019s self-reinforcing.\u201d\nTo explain that psychology  Ludwin invokes John Maynard Keynes. The economist likened investing to a newspaper contest where readers were asked to pick the picture of the person the majority of other people would find most attractive. To win  a reader would have to discard his own judgment and bet purely on a guess of what the average person would find beautiful. Or  maddeningly  even on what the other players would think the average player would like. Cryptocurrency in general is \u201creally one of the most beautiful distillations of the Keynesian beauty contest that\u2019s ever existed \u201d says Ludwin. All investments have some of this speculative element  but unlike  say  a stock   Bitcoin  isn\u2019t a claim on future earnings to which investors can hitch a valuation. To bet on  Bitcoin  is to believe simply that others will want  it .\nOne read on the psychology of  the Bitcoin boom  is that  it \u2019s part of a broad bull market in all kinds of assets. Despite anxieties about politics  North Korea  and rising equity valuations  investors seem to be in a mood to embrace risk and are fearful of missing out on big gains. Or perhaps  Bitcoin  is the shadow side of that optimism: Many are drawn to cryptocurrency because they see  it  as a palliative to the system that came crashing down in 2008  and their belief in  Bitcoin  has been hard to shake. Market psychology is difficult to pin down\u2014the one thing that\u2019s reliable about it is its volatility.", "Lasted a year and broke right at the attachment point.

I wanted 'Johnny Be Good' a comedy that co-stars Robert Downey, Jr. and Uma Thurman (in her film debut) but instead I got 'The Dead Zone'- no laughs and horrendously bad performances from a couple of stiffs. Each one of the three leads are incredibly likable and versatile, in other  movies, so it's disappointing they couldn't bring some sort of life to their idiotic characters. Hall sleepwalks through his role mumbling all of his dialogue so that it's barely intelligible and Downey Jr. is so over-the-top it's grating and even painful to watch. I'm not implying anything, but both men had well documented substance problems around the time the movie was made. Maybe that would explain some of the more confusing and bizarre aspects of their performances. Thurman isn't given anything more to do than look beautiful as Hall's girlfriend and throw a couple of tantrums whenever her immature boyfriend misbehaves, which is often.\n\nJohnny Walker (Hall) is a star high-school football player who finds himself bombarded with offers from college scouts who all want him to play for their teams. Promised endless amounts of money, girls, fame, and apartments, Johnny can't decide where he should go. His best friend Leo (Downey Jr.) isn't good enough to make it on his own so his only hope is to convince Johnny to go to UCC where both men are guaranteed spots on the team. The boy's obnoxious coach Hisler (Paul Gleason), has his own motives for convincing Johnny what college to attend. If he can get Walker to sign with Piermont University, Hisler will get the head  coaching job. Unable to make up his mind Johnny goes on several campus tours where he sees everything but the campus. Tons of cheerleaders, hookers and strippers make themselves readily available for Johnny and four other draft picks. When he gets back from these tours his girlfriend Georgia (Thurman) is none too happy to learn of her boyfriend's indiscretions. Georgia wants Johnny to go to college with her so that they'll stay together. What's a boy like John to do? The film doesn't attempt to come up with answers, instead trafficking in stereotypes and cliches. None of the characters or situations they find themselves in are believable at all.

The bare bones version is a little less expensive at first glance, but is more expensive in the long run.\n\nFor example: all games, and any use of Xbox Live, require some kind of memory storage. The bare-bones system does not come with any memory. You *have* to buy it seperately, which eats up 1/2 the price difference between the Core and the full version. Another example: the Core does not have high-def output cables. If you have a Core and you want to actually see the fancy graphics that the Xbox 360 is producing, you have to go out and buy a set of expensive cables--which eats the other half of the cost difference. If you want a wireless controller you have to buy that separately too, and now the Core is more expensive than the full version.\n\nIn conclusion: if you want the Xbox 360 experience then buy the full machine, not this crippled \"core\" version.

It touched me deeply as a child, and even as an adult I dust off my old hardcover and reread it every few years. The movie was a profound disappointment--a cotton candy-like ball of Hollywood fluff more worthy of the Olsen sisters than an adaptation of one of the best novels ever written.\n\nMany details of the story were changed, an overhaul I would endorse if the new stuff were compelling. I personally do not feel movies need to slavishly follow books, as a great director can bring a fresh eye to a classic story, making it his own. But here, every addition or change was pointless and served only to diminish the power of the story. As just one example, in the original story--where hunger was a major theme--Sara gives a starving illiterate scullery maid a meat pie to eat. In this movie, it seems to be about lack of luxury footwear: Sarah gives the servant a pair of Mae West style fur-trimmed slippers with a note that says, \"Let's be friends.\"\n\nBut it's not the minor details that result in this movie becoming a tragic dumbing down of a great classic, it's the big ones. The main message of the movie is a jawdroppingly meaningless platitude:\"every girl is a princess.\" The original, by contrast, was about one exceptional girl whose beautiful soul and empathy for others continued even as she was transformed overnight from a rich, pampered elite boarder to a pauper. In the book, her self-control and nobility of spirit made her a princess, no matter her circumstances. Lesson to little girls: It's what's inside that matters.\n\nFor those who love the book, I highly recommend the BBC version starring Amelia Shankley. This beautiful, realistic and haunting version brought tears to my eyes. I watched it for the first time last night on YouTube simply because I had to cleanse myself from the insipid Cuar&oacute;n version. I recommend that anyone reading this skip the intermediate step and pass right to the BBC version, which is also available through Amazon on DVD:<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/A-Little-Princess/dp/B001T46T8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Little Princess</a>.", "I haven't use it yet so I can't confirm on the product yet, but I was only given 1 bag of the wax and it says it comes with 4.

Do not use them and waste your money.", "This kit is horrible - when compared to other kits.  With the standard kit you get 5 boards - 3 for the table and 2 for the bench seats.  For this table and two benches you need to mess around with 20 boards!  Clean 20 boards.  Stain/paint 20 boards.  Align 20 boards.  And cut 4 boards to a different length then the rest.  And trying to get 20 good 2x4s that are perfectly straight is a futile effort.  I think the table does look nicer, but it is not worth the hassle and work compared to other picnic table kits.  The reason I bought this kit was for the resin frame.  The picnic table this is replacing is the standard 5 boards with the metal frame, but after around 20 years the frame has become weak and you can no longer sit on it.  Otherwise the wood is still good.  I guess I don't see any reason why one couldn't use a wider board with this resin frame kit - just have to measure to make sure they fit properly.  If I had to do it over I would just buy the 5 board kit again.  I received 2 different types of screws with this kit - one kind for the table and a different kind (regular deck screws) for the benches.  You would think they would be the same, wouldn't you?  I put my parent's picnic table together when I was a kid (standard 5 boards with a metal frame) and didn't have the problems I had with this setup.  Messing around with all of the 2x4s just isn't worth it.\n\nUpdate - a couple of more things.  The deck screws that come with the bench are 2\", so if you don't drive them at an angle you may come out the wood on the other side.  The diagram directions do show the screws going in at a angle, but there are no written directions with the benches (the table has written directions and no diagram directions) so I just wanted to point this out so others don't put them straight through.  I did not have a problem since I put them in at an angle.  Also - shame on you Amazon for putting the shipping labels directly over the diagram directions - on both packages!  Couldn't remove the shipping labels without tearing the diagram directions.  And think about the longterm - when it comes time to re-paint/stain you are either going to have to skip doing it inbetween the boards or you are going to have to remove them.  I would never buy this kit again and wish I hadn't.\n\n8/28/08 - update.  I ordered another bench to do what another person had done and suggested - put a support in the center of each bench to help supoort and firm things up.  I highly recommend doing this (if you were unlucky enough to purchase this kit).  My bench was only 6 ft long, but still had some wobble (probably because of the cheap deck screws).  So, for 2 benches you would purchase 3 of the bench frames and split the one between the two for center supports.  With this bench I received the CORRECT SCREWS!  The shorter, silver, bigger head screws - they secure so much better!  The 2\" deck screws I received with the other two benches are just the standard ugly 2\" deck screws that if you are not careful to dril at an angle you will put them all the way through the wood.  The heads on them are also much smaller so they do not secure very well and in some cases are small enough to go into/through the plastic slots.  It sure would have been nice to have received the correct screws with everything.  I have spent $181.21  - 3 benches, 1 table, the wood, a gallon of stain and a couple of ultra cheap/disposable brushes.  Not worth the money or time. I highly recommend NOT getting this kit being they can't even include the correct screws.

Otherwise I'd give these speakers a 3 star.\n\nI purchased a set of these from Amazon for a surround sound based on the many recommendations. Because they come in pairs I stopped off at the local Fry's store to buy a single center speaker to complete the set. Fry's had all of the Polk series setup in their sound room so I compared them. After listening the RC60i, and then listening to the TC60i I have to say I regret buying the RC60i. The TC60i makes these speakers sound flat and the quality approaches that of a mid quality boom box while the TC60i sounds fantastic. The salesman told me that the RC60i are Polks entry level ceiling speaker.\n\nIf you can afford the extra money and are installing into the ceiling, buy the TC60i. If you are mounting in the wall stay with the RC60i as they are not as deep.\n\nAnother consideration too is that if you are putting these in the ceiling and have blown insulation you will want to handle that somehow. I wrote Polk audio and there solution was the insulation doesn't matter but if I'm really worried about it I could put a stocking around the speaker. I was surprised with that response. It doesn't deal with the \"dead\" sound you get when the speaker has insulation all around it. If you clear the insulation away you defeat the purpose of having insulation in the attic. Other speaker manufacturers offer enclosures designed to fit their speaker with the correct volume and sound baffles, Polk audio does not. I also noticed that if I didn't \"box\" the speakers that the sound carried into the attic, out the house vents and into other rooms through the ductwork.\n\nYou will definitely want to build an enclosure to house the speakers in the attic. I did that then buried the box in insulation.\n\nYou also want to use a good twisted pair speaker wire instead of ordinary speaker wire. This eliminate the 60 hz hum that will be picked up from the 115 house wiring that is probably all over your attic.

No one else can so convincingly freak out and tear a plane apart looking for her potentially-fictional daughter, even in the midst of a plot that Foster had to know was so riddled with holes as to make a block of swiss cheese seem completely solid in comparison.\n\nFollow me through this: An exceedingly small cabal of terrorists, composed of a rogue air marshal, a flight attendant, and a funeral director, plan to murder the husband of a local engineer on the grounds that she will then book the next flight back to her parents in America on the big plane she's been working on. She will, of course, be bringing her husband's coffin on the same flight, which is crucial because they can hide explosives in the coffin where they won't be found (security doesn't scan coffins because....um.).\n\nAs part of the plan, it is absolutely essential that no one on a sold-out flight ever notices the engineer's daughter. I mean, seriously, not one child can say they saw the girl, not one parent can register \"hey, that kid's jumper is the same one I bought for Susan,\" nothing like that. This myopia must extend even to not noticing when the air marshal and flight attendant drug the girl, stuff her into a food cart, remove her luggage from the overhead bin, and steal the boarding pass from Foster's pant pocket.\n\nOnce Foster comes to, it is vital to the plan of the terrorists that she completely freak out and start turning the plane upside down looking for the little girl. Now to some people, that behavior may be a given, but it's just as possible that the mother might figure that, after all, it's a closed plane and she's not going anywhere, so she must have found some kids to play with and is moving through the grieving process healthily, so maybe it's best to give her some space and collect her when we land. Whatever, Foster freaks out and elicits the captain's aid on the grounds that the flight crew is less than helpful.\n\nHardly any time has passed before the captain has helpfully radioed ground control to find that the computer says (those frisky terrorists) that the little girl never even boarded. Displaying an uncharacteristic faith in computers, the crew figure that that is that, an assumption further backed up by another radio from the morgue stating that the little girl is, in fact, dead - even though there's only one coffin aboard, a detail that the captain is wholly incurious about.\n\nAlso, there's a red herring with some Arabic passengers whom Foster believes she has seen staring into her daughter's window a few nights before.\n\nEventually, the plane lands, the entire flight crew is ushered off except the terrorist flight attendant who inexplicably isn't, and Foster demonstrates that not only does an engineer know EVERYTHING about the plane she builds engines for, she also knows enough about explosives to tell, at a glance, what she can and can't blow up without damage to herself or daughter. She walks off the tarmac with daughter in hand, and everyone realizes that the crazy terrorist woman MUST be innocent, now that she has a little girl who vaguely looks like her.\n\nReally, \"Flightplan\" is something of an enigma in that everyone on the project MUST have known what a terrible story they were telling, but they still do their best. The acting varies from superb (Foster) to decent (everyone else), the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and the sheer amount of effort that went into this movie is clear on every frame. I'm frankly astonished that they tried so hard, but they did. The result, however, is that the movie is unwieldy, boring, and trite since we never seriously suspect that Foster might be insane and the sheer inanity of the terrorist plot hurts the viewer's head.\n\n~ Ana Mardoll", "The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism, but it's really nothing more than warmed over Cold War paranoia.", "Bad storytelling all around.

Different scenes require the detail that the author provides, but other infusions of tedious facts slow down an already slow story. Clancy crushes us into submission by explaining to us in too much detail that he has obviously read too many books.  A few examples of the task of reading Red October. The first two paragraphs are excerpts from the book, while the third, my own creation, rams my point home.  (1)\"Today the inside valve war closed, along with the corresponding through-hull fitting. The valves were made of titanium because they had to function reliably after prolonged exposure to high temperature, and also because titanium war very corrosion-resistant high-temperature water war murderously corrosive. What had not been fully considered war that the metal war also exposed to intense nuclear radiation, and this particular titanium alloy war not completely stable under extended neutron bombardment. The metal had become brittle over the years. The minute waves of hydraulic pressure were beating against the clapper in the valve. As the pump's frequency of vibration changed it began to approach the frequency at which the clapper vibrated. This caused the clapper to snap harder and harder against its retaining ring. The metal at its edges began to crack....  (2)\"In the reactor spaces aft, Lieutenant Butler had his engine men acknowledge the command and gave the necessary orders The reactor coolant pumps went to fast speed. An increased amount of hot, pressurized water entered the exchanger, where its heat war transferred to the steal on the outside loop. When the coolant returned to the reactor it was cooler than it had been and therefore denser. Being denser, it trapped more neutrons in the reactor pile, increasing the ferocity of the fission reaction and giving off yet more power. Farther aft, saturated steam in the \"outside\" or nonradioactive loop of the heat exchange system emerged through clusters of control valves to strike the blades of the high-pressure turbine. The Dallas' huge bronze screw began to turn more quickly, driving her forward and down...  (3, my own)\"It had been a long day, and Ryan needed to stay on top of it, which meant more black coffee. The coffee-making unit had a swivel compartment which opened for the insertion of a No 2 paper filter, filled with enough grounds for as many as ten cups of coffee. Once secure, closing the circuit caused heating coils under the decanter to expand and grow hotter, while internally-heated water descended through the grounds contained in the coffee basin, falling into the decanter as hot coffee....  Conclusion: There are several moments of excitement in Red October , and the characters are beautifully portrayed, but unfortunately, hours of tedium have to be survived by the reader If it weren't for the book, we might have been able to enjoy the story. Upon further reflection, the story wasn't that good either.  The story in itself is quite interesting and thoroughly researched, and this is the fundamental problem. The book opens with the decision to head west from the Norwegian Sea, and ever reader is easily convinced of its potential success and its absolute provocation. The reader is introduced to the vessel and its confident skipper, and the story gets underway smoothly.  Not before long, the reader finds himself consumed in page after page of government arguments and actions in both Washington and Moscow. Certainly this is for \"real\" historical procedure. However, the reader instantly feels the tedium while these talks continue, falling prey to the boredom which these government officials themselves must have felt at the same instant. Whether this is done for effect, there is no telling, but the result is to stifle the initial action, and therefore, the plot.  The reader is introduced to a score of minor characters who play a small one-time role, yet we are forced to know their entire dossiers. The constant jump back to historic facts is difficult to overcome when there is already a huge labyrinth of loose ends in front of us. After all the detail of these proceedings, and the detail of the minor events alone the way (those that have very little weight in the overall drama), we have world-class dyspepsia in our bowels.  Finally, the reader is reacquainted with the Russian vessel, and is allowed to follow its actions once again, after mercilessly being diverted from it. After an exciting final chase, covered quite dexterously from ship to ship by the author, the reader is liberated from the remorseless detail of earlier passages, and is free to choose whether or not the outcome was worth the price it required.  But then, what of other stories in Red October? Spies are left hanging in Moscow, and there is talk of removing them from the country; a Soviet sailor is left in a hospital bed who we must assume will recover (a fact which is covered at length, except his recovery); certain salvage operations are discussed and explained but neglected; after the October's crew is returned safely, a possible Soviet counter-operation is only \"discussed\" in Moscow; and two Soviet vessels (the Konovalov and the Shabilikov-p. 403) stay behind to sink the October yet only one is destroyed (the Konovalov , but still another unidentified ship is left after a total recall of all others from the Atlantic, p. 418); what are the fates of these?  In sum, the many interruptions were not cleared up satisfactorily, the level of detail was oppressive too often, and the real chase and excitement of the book were much underplayed. I would have to say that there was a good chance here for a great book, yet Tom Clancy did not deliver it on his first try out.", "I couldn't even watch half of it!!", "Ask me the WEIRDEST question EVAR!! http://formspring.me/agentshawnee", "Nothing I can do w/a broke man but worry abt who he's fucking while I'm working, did he eat up the food & is he gon b late picking me up lol", "I purchased this item based on reviews.

If I'm fortunate enough to get a refund then I will be spending my hard-earned money on another set of Bluetooth headphones - surely ANYTHING will be better than this! :(", "For someone that is only 98 lbs and 5'0 run way to small I got my daughter the M but still. She was looking forward. \ud83d\ude10", "I bought a Nook Tablet based on the principle that it was much more than an eReader and was backed by an upstanding company in Barnes & Noble.\n\nAt the price point the hardware is truly magnificent with a wonderful screen, fast processor, good storage capacity and an SD card. I didn't need the GPS and cameras that are 'missing'. The 7\" form factor turned out to be ideal for my purposes.\n\nThe selection of eBooks from Barnes & Noble is excellent and even the magazines I bought are more than readable. Netflix video quality, while not High Definition, is certainly High Quality and is simply stunning with the right movie and since I am a Netflix streaming subscriber already, was 'free' to me. So far so good.\n\nHere's the rub. The selection of apps from B&N is truly pitiful. I mean, worse than you can imagine. Now combine this with the fact that the standard email client as installed on the NT is very basic and limited and the standard web browser is little better. There are no replacements in the app store. None. What you see is what you get.\n\nAnd something else makes it even worse. You can't add your Google accounts in order to sync with Google services such as contacts, calendar, reader etc.\n\nThe sad thing is the hardware is MORE THAN capable of running all these services but is being prevented from doing so by the B&N tablet software and their 'walled garden' approach - similar to that adopted by Apple but without their huge app store and connected services to create the illusion that you are not in an ecosystem prison.\n\nThere were originally two ways that NT owners could enhance the tablet but B&N are now attempting to close both of these paths with their latest operating system 'upgrade' (version 1.4.1) that is automatically installed on your Nook Tablet when you connect to the internet. They issued this 'bug fix' release on December 23rd. Bah humbug is right.\n\n1. 'Sideloading' of applications was possible on version 1.4.0 and this let you install applications from sources other than B&N's paltry selection. So, for instance, you could install Dolphin Browser for tabbed web browsing and gesture input or Skitmail for a real email experience. Now that's all gone and you get no option to add apps that B&N don't have - which is most of them.  My guess is that for most users, sideloading would have resolved the issue of the inadequate B&N app store. had they been smart, B&N would have delayed implementing the blocking until they could dramatically increase their selection of apps.\n\n2. 'Rooting' the tablet is a way to bypass the B&N controls and open up the tablet to the full Android experience which not only means access to the Google market and Google apps but also to 'superuser'  functions to enable enhanced control of the operating system. This is not for novices and requires some technical understanding of the Android operating system so likely only a very small number of advanced users would ever attempt this. B&N have attempted to block this too. Really? What exactly is the point B&N?\n\nSo, what we have here is a truly excellent piece of hardware with a fantastic eReader infrastructure capable of doing so much more than it is permitted to do by Barnes & Noble. Their motivation is to force users to buy only from them - which as Apple have proved - is perfectly okay if you make the selection big enough. Problem is, the selection is totally, hopelessly, unbelievably inadequate. Barnes & Noble will still have a huge hit on it's hands because many people have relatively simple needs. The pity is it could have been a massive home run in their battle to stay alive in the space they compete for with Amazon.\n\nSo what to do? With a heavy heart I will likely return my gorgeous Nook Tablet and spend just a little more for a real 7\" tablet upon which I will install a Nook app and be very happy. I simply don't have the time, patience or inclination to fight a company that has proven it just doesn't 'get it'.\n\nKnow what you are getting into before you buy.", "It's a sad day when you realize your teachers text you more than your friends .-. #foreveralone", "on hold for another half hour. phone is ringing but no one is picking up.@apple you stink.", "No one's going to dispute the greatness of this album.

And now that the record label has re-mastered it, they want to charge $1.29 per track?  It's not a whole new album that they need to recoup their studio costs on, how much could the re-mastering possibly have cost?  I'd like to have the modern re-master that sounds as good as it should on today's audio equipment, but I've paid for this album enough.

And, to be fair, its first book \"The Summer Tree\" isn't utterly bad. There actually are moments when the story holds your interest. The problem is, there aren't many of them, and for long stretches this book, like its sequel \"The Wandering Fire,\" suffer from long passages that alternate between floridly contrived and floridly maudlin.\n\nGuy Gavriel Kay even panders to the purient interest of juveniles with a character (Kevin) who has a strangely mystical reaction to sex. \"The Summer Tree\" has a lot of exaggerated emotionalism, college-age young adults who act melodramatically as if they were fourteen-year-olds. And it has more than its share of pseudo-intellectualizing -- \"deep\" thoughts spun out of thin air and presented as if they were profound, which they are not. Maybe Kay was targeting a 14-year-old audience with this book.\n\nKay pilfers from the Jesus-on-the-Cross story, using another of his characters (Paul) as a sacrifice tied to a tree (for three days, of course).\n\nBe warned readers: this is no \"Ring of the Nibelung\" here. Despite what some have said about the book, it is nowhere near the same league with The Hobbit, and although you can tell that Kay is trying hard, his descriptive powers aren't on a level with Tolkien's. The Fionavar Tapestry is a story, but it is barely a story.  Calling it literature would be going too far, and let's not mention art.\n\nDespite its serious flaws (from an adult point of view), the story is readable, and, some of the time, even enjoyable.  That being said, there's just no way the story is good enough to deserve the glowing endorsements given it by such luminous writers as Andre Norton, Charles de Lint, and Marion Zimmer Bradley, all of whom, if they are still alive, should be ashamed of themselves for giving The Fionavar Tapestry excessively high praise.", "@JetBlue im still waiting???
