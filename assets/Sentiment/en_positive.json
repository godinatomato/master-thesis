It never grows old; the characters step out of the pages and grab your heart and you are filled with longing for a land you haven't ever seen and yet know well.\n\nA work of genius.", "I have been reading this book slowly. Having regarded spirituality as a form of pietist escapism and regarding the contemporary trend towards spirituality with great suspicion, I have read very little in this area beyond 'The Cloud of Unknowing' which I read too quickly and gained nothing from and some stuff by Thomas a Kempis when I was a teenager and which appealed to me greatly at the time. It came as a surprise, therefore, to see how perceptive Teresa was on many things and I have to conclude that, far from being escapist, there is probably much in 'spiritual writing' that brings us more closely in touch with those parts of our inner selves which we ignore and repress and avoid by overmuch business. Too much 'being' and not enough 'doing' is wrong but so is the other way round.\n\nIn the first mansion, Teresa testifies to incarnation and to the importance of 'ordinary people'. That God condescends to dwell in our innermost being affirms our importance because he loves us. We should not look down on those who are not overtly religious - he has different gifts for us all because we ore individuals with differing needs and abilities. I had thought that spiritual types tended to regard themselves as special and I now learn that they do so, but that is because all people are special, in different ways. There is much in the charismatic movement that can go off when the twice-born despise the others and this is a good corrective.\n\nI like Teresa's recogition that prayer changes at different times of life and according to our daily rhythm. Thus I need to be more reflective in term-time as an oasis of stillness amidst busy-ness but also to extend the time spent on it at weekends and in the holidays so as to enlarge my 'space' and make it more accessible when there is less time.\n\nI like Teresa's belief that God's grace seeks us but we can block reception of it by sin - not little acts so much as a way of being. Far from moralising, it seems to me that Teresa is saying something about what it means to become fully human. There s a time when 'becoming human' was a cliche I didn't really understand but I think it is beginning to make sense now. That part of our stunting of our spiritual growth is to be tied to cares in this world still strikes me as escapist but inasmuch as over-busy-ness distorts our humanity (the protestant work ethic for example) I see that she has an important message for this century. A routine spiritual life impresses others but we are often justifying ourselves by religiosity. She says that God will take care of the religious types.\n\nTrue - I could attend a thousand daily masses with very little feeling, could exalt the importance of routine, and yet be pulled up short by one phrase in the liturgy that challenges my seeking for security in ritualised religiosity.\n\nMaking a virtue out of a well-ordered, calculated lifestyle is something I am prone to do. It seems silly to make mistakes and to forget appointments on purpose but I need to free myself from that part of routine which is obssessive rather than enabling. Before reading Teresa, I never would have thought of routine living as a matter for self-examination. The danger in tinkering with the routine once aware of its dangers is that, in Teresa's imagery in the third mansion, we dig a small hole and see light but then the routine returns in a reordered way and the earth collapses in on us again.\n\nBy the fourth mansion I begin to flounder because it is getting beyond me. I recognise much about myself and other people in the previous pages but talk of the dark night of the soul becomes 'advanced'. Aridity, deadness in prayer I understated - coupled with doctrinal doubt, with wondering whether God exists anyway, it was not surprising that I used to go for months through barren rituals which, but for anglo-catholic talk of objective prayer I would have given up years ago, but to mistake this for a dark night experience is, of course, wrong, though much of Teresa' counsel for this situation applies in aridity - to keep on with prayer in a disciplined way and ask God for what he is to give and yet -Act worry if feelings and consolations are lacking - he knows best. The seed can grow so secretly inside us that even we do not become aware of it. The testis in what those who live with us can see. Too true - those in convents are bound to know this more than anyone else. On spiritual cloud nines in my youth I was an arrogant so and so; what love and patience those I looked down on had towards me: The seed growing secretly in us is the way in which the kingdom comes. Whatever grand schemes we have to change the world, if the desire is not rooted in the hearts and wills of ordinary men and women, our schemes will collapse as did the Tower of Babel. I rebel against this motion, afraid that it is a cop-out from Christian involvement in politics. The spirituality trend of this decade is fortunately arriving hand in hand with liberation theology becoming more well-known and narrative theology. Maybe the Spirit is correcting imbalances but not by an imbalance on the opposite side but by different movements of thought hitting a complacent, sick Western church.\n\nI like Teresa's imagery of the people in the grounds of the castle but hearing the call of the one within - reapplied as a metaphor of the worker priest, indeed of all those lay people who seek to discern God in the secular world but need to retreat to the citadel of the church - albeit finding it less of a retreat and more of a journey into themselves where they encounter more 'worms', all this seems very true.\n\nThe image of the silk worm emerging into a butterfly and its taking nourishment from a leaf while seemingly dead - in the 5th mansion - however much the biology is inept, also makes sense. The routine (which I hitherto identified as potentially harmful) has its uses as a discipline, as a means to an end rather than the end itself. The image also goes some way to allay the fears of what we might become - we were scared of being born and leaving the womb's security and we are surely afraid of where the Spirit might lead us next and of the ultimate growth which is death itself. Whether we have sufficiently died to ourselves to have developed the wings is a better way of looking at judgement than is the heaven and hell thing.\n\nThe stuff on visions seems to me to be esoteric but I have read enough material from the Religious Experience Research Unit to convine me that visions are far more commonplace in human experience than many of us realise.\n\nSo, there is much that is good here and much that I am not mature enough to understand.", "Holds up the front of our 5th wheel trailer", "Just what I was looking for at a reasonable price.

Some people have complained about the sound quality, but my CD does not sound that bad.  The sound and mix are all part of the ambience of the space music.\n\nThis is kind of guitar driven space, ambient music.  It is a lot like Pink Floyd's album More, only the spacier parts are drawn out to a full, feature length CD.\n\nThis is very good and interesting space music.  It doesn't get boring or tedious. Later in the CD, saxophones are added to give the music some variety. You can listen to the whole thing in one sitting. But, at the same time, it could make very interesting background music.\n\nThe only problem is that it all sounds alike.  I listened to this CD and then another Verve CD and I though I accidently played the same CD twice.  But, then I checked....yes these were different CD's with different songs.\n\nThe Verve (not to be confused with Verve Pipe) lasted about 6 years.  They put out 3 full length CD's and a ton of EP's.  I have a compilation CD where they tried accoustic music and actually singing songs!  It wasn't very good.\n\nYOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT FRANCIS MONKMAN, JAM.

That's a pretty big bet, considering how good of a game and how sought after Grand Theft Auto III was a couple of years back. However, I believe that True Crime may be able to live up to what it says it can. First off, True Crime Streets of L.A. is being developed by Activision, a videogaming heavyweighr. Activision has the potential to make this game a hit. I just question how willing they are to make it good. So far, it looks to me like they are doing a fine job. At E3, the booth for True Crime was a hotspot for gamers, and the game was very impressive for all who saw it. The graphics were better than the GTA games, probably at least on par with the great graphics in The Getaway. True Crime featured 240 square miles of re-created L.A. territory, and the city looked great. The game just had the atmosphere of L.A. There was Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and even ghetto paradise within the game. There were hot rides in hot areas of the city, and old Buicks in the not-so-nice parts as well. (I prefer the ghetto life!) The people were good too. There were gangstas, ho's, businessman, snobs, everything that you would actually see in real-life L.A. Landmarks were recognizable, from the skyscrapers to the Mann's Chinese Theater. The sound was just flatout AWESOME as well. Cars were realistic, pedestrians chatted, music pumped in the background. And as a bonus, there will be over 50 beats from real life west coast rappers like Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. I am psyched about that!! I am a huge rap fan! The sound to me seems just as good or possibly better than the awesome sound effects in GTA Vice City. You play as a cop, Nick Kang, who can either be good cop, or bad cop, whichever road you wish to put him on in the game. And the game will tilt that way too. Be a baddie, and you'll be swarmed by vigilantes and even your fellow police. Be a good guy, and the game may be a little easier or a little harder, depending on your view. So far, True Crime looks awesome. It could give the GTA series a run for its money. Roll out the red carpet this fall.

Ace combat 5 has a storyline that flows over into your actual mission flight, which I find annoying, In Ace Combat 5, you can't upgrade or choose weapons for the planes, whereas you can in Ace Combat 4.  And Ace Combat 5 forces you to \"unlock\" new planes, VERY ANNOYING; in Ace Combat 4, the planes become available as you move along in the campaign.  And in Ace Combat 5, you cannot fly back to base to repair and rearm.... EXTREMELY ANNOYING!!.  some of the missions in AC5 are really annoying, such as following an old ace pilot to run away, flying a recon mission to take pictures.... with only ten camera shots.

I've had other roller-style items that try to tip over, so it was nice that this one didn't.\n\nThere are two things that were interesting about this bag that I wouldn't say detract from it, but left me wondering why it was done that way.  First was that the carry handle is a double handle with a velcro clasp that you would normally find with a two-part handle on either side of a zipper, but there is nothing between the two handles.  There's nothing wrong with it, and the handle performed perfectly when I used it, but I'm not sure why it was designed with the ability to separate.  Second is the shoulder strap.  When in use, it goes from top right to bottom left (as you're looking at the picture), which means that when you carry it, the bag tries to remain flat.  It might have made more sense to have the strap centered or on one side so that it would carry more like a guitar with the thin-side up.\n\nOvereall, I really like the case, and it performed nicely in actual use.", "I just love scary movie that have a really god plot and a lot of blood and guts they are the best", "Tons of crackers and has lasted us a while now", "Already drawing in huge numbers of Cardinals as well as other desirable birds with this feeder.

(in other words, a little bit shorter than your standard 70-minute cd) containing seven songs, all inspired by a movie in which Bjork played the starring role (Selma). The movie was called \"Dancer in the Dark\", and it was reported to be a painful and difficult experience for her, despite rave reviews and accolades. The experience of acting may have been a nightmare, but Bjork found use for it by allowing it to push her to a new level of emotional creativity. Throughout, Bjork connotes the playful, but portrays the dramatic.\n\nBjork apparently has access to a bottomless pit of creative ideas. Her vistas appear to be boundless, using virtually everything to aid her vision - synchronized factory noises, onomatopoeia, trains, orchestras - who else could claim Catherine Deneuve and Thom Yorke as guest vocalists on the same album? Bjork is contemplative, but she remains somebody who makes lemonade out of lemons. I haven't seen the movie...yet...so it's still difficult for me to understand the lyrical significance of a song titled \"107 Steps\". While the movie will clarify this further, I'm sure, I'm interested in Selmasongs solely as a listening experience. Its atmospherics are as visual as any projected image, so you can almost see each song as presentations of an image. Purportedly, Bjork's character was blind, so it's significant that this music is so visual in its presentation. The song \"Scatterheart\" is a focal point - lush, gorgeous, expressive - along with the dreamily optimistic \"In the Musicals.\" The orchestration is remarkable throughout, too. It provides brilliant colors for the odd melodies of the album's opening and closing theme (\"Overture\", \"New World\"). Based on this soundtrack, I can't wait to see the movie.

The English country house, locked room murder tale has been overdone a bit (I eschew hyperbole), but it seems fresh-born here.  Perhaps it is because this is the author's first-born mystery novel and she cared about what she was doing.\nOther reviewers have described the actual plot, so I will not repeat that.  Suffice it to say that the plot works, and the surprises are indeed unexpected.  The logic and denouement are fair to the reader.  The plot doesn't have to be perfect.  It just has to...\"work,\" for lack of a better verb.  Mystery readers, often without knowing it, read this genre not for the ingenious plot but for the feel of place and for the characters.

Now if you find a person who builds you a house, you move in, and you find it has charm but is built like c**p, you of course will be pleased with how it makes you feel, but disappointed that what you paid for, you didn't get. Now say you find another person who builds you an expertly crafted house, but it lacks a certain homely charm. Does that mean you race back to the cr***y house?\nSongwriting is a craft, like any other trade, any other thing you can do with your mind, hands or both. Like blacksmiths, carpenters, and farmers, the artist / musician is constantly developing and improving their technique and proficiency to present you (a person who may not be skilled in such a craft) a thing which is well presented and should suit your tastes in somehow,someway. Whether this is overall, or momentary is up to you as 'the buyer'. But if you're satisified at least once, then they have succeeded.\nAnd TOTO succeeded with TOTO IV in a major way. To fault them for finally honing a songwriting craft after 4 years of steady work, and 10 years of professional session work, and that people of all types responded to it enthusiastically, is more to do with you than them. I'm not trying to look at TOTO IV with rose coloured glasses, but one thing that cannot be found on here is bad musicianship.\nAs a musician, I learned an immense amount of craft from TOTO, and I will always be thankful to them (primarily the Kimball / Hungate / Paich / Porcaro / Lukather / Porcaro lineup)and I find nowhere else in their first four albums where this craft is presented so refined and polished than on TOTO IV. To maybe a listener who is just looking for gripping songs, or dramatic flourishes, or fits of anger or paeans to love, they will not find it here. For me, what I look for is someone who cares about what they're doing, shows it, and walks away saying 'I did my best'. And TOTO IV delivers that.\nHow anyone can say 'Waiting For Your Love' is a filler tune to the likes of Africa and Roseanne, I cannot comprehend. Have you actually heard the groove of this song? I hate to get all imploring, but have you heard the way Jeff Porcaro plays the hi-hat on this song? If it was jazz great Harvey Mason, you may say different, you might even listen, because its Mason and you're supposed to, but the playing of these musicians is almost perfect - the right amount of technique and feel. So it's alright if its Steely Dan, but not TOTO aye?\n'Waiting For Your Love' and 'Good For You' are absolutely my favourite songs on here for the reasons stated above, the musicianship and playing skills of these people, and how much it adds to just a song. If you cannot find heart or soul in the playing of these musicians, or at least some passion for what they are doing, then maybe I can only suggest picking up an instrument and learn these songs, because you will find how 'on' you have to be to play them with as much 'feel' thats in them.\nI just think you have to be at a certain point where crash crash bang bang just doesn't hold as much interest any more, and funnily enough I reached that point at 20 years old. And I thank TOTO for showing me that being a musician is more than just flicking your hair, and drinking booze and talking about your car.", "I bought this Fiskars Softgrip Bypass Pruner to replace the one I bought last year.

Most seem to be built well, but I did buy this one to replace another brand in which the yellow wire was not connected to any of the connector spades.\n\nThat said, here's the simple way to navigate the mess that is connector color codings. You can try to navigate the differences in color function and plug position among \"standard\", \"traditional\", and other color code schemes that can be different for trucks, trailers, and RV's, as well as different in different parts of the world, and maybe difference on your vehicle, but unless you already work in the field, you will likely never be sure what you have. Maybe not even then.\n\nWith this cable, plugged into a Reese Towpower 74682 7 Way Multi-Plug T-Connector Assembly, which was connected to a 2003 Suburban via the Suburban's trailer wiring connector, it turned out that RED is left turn, BROWN is right turn, and GREEN is tail or running lights. The other wires are presumably consistent with that established scheme.  I'm pretty sure more than one of you is saying, \"Whoa, that doesn't agree with what I thought the color scheme was.\"  It doesn't agree with the color scheme I was thinking I would be following, either. But I would not have known that with confidence unless I had checked each color for function by plugging it into the car and testing each wire while I operated the turn signals and running lights.\n\nI could test further to see which blade was associated with each color wire, but I don't need to know that, since I know what each color does. And I could not have been certain any other way. (Obviously, if I don't have a vehicle trailer wiring connector and have to run my own, I need to go further and use the meter to see which blade carries power to each color.) But, the bonus is that I also know that the vehicle trailer wiring is intact, so if something doesn't work on the trailer (1953 Airstream being revamped), I know the fault is in the trailer's own wiring, the wiring I did. That won't happen, because an Ohmmeter can tell you if the trailer lights are wired correctly and are properly grounded.\n\nSo that's the lesson. Don't worry about pin configurations or which color system is intended. Test colors for function, and test your trailer light circuits for continuity, before you make the connects from the cable to the trailer wires. Then you can wire with confidence, because a color error by some Chinese factory drone no longer matters. And you will have caught any major manufacturing fault, like my other cable with one wire not connected at all, before you do a bunch of work.", "Bought these as replacement for well used pruner.

Kicking off in 1972 with \"Can't Buy A Thrill\", the sound was predominantly guitar-driven, with hints of jazz chops and addictive hooks.  By the time \"Pretzel Logic\" hit the shelves in 1974, vocalist Michael McDonald had enhanced the Dan's musical schema with some blue-eyed soul, and the hits started pouring out.  \"Rikki Don't Lose That Number\".  \"Black Friday\".  The title track--all classics.  With \"Katy Lied\" and \"The Royal Scam\", SD anchored themselves into the mainstream-cum-progressive category by continuing to push the envelope with avant-garde chord changes and airtight harmonies.  So, when \"Aja\" debuted in 1977, the Dan were ready to drop a bomb into the spotlight.  A tough act to follow, \"Aja\" raised the bar for the wannabe acts with masterful musicianship by Wayne Shorter, Jeff Porcaro, Larry Carlton, McDonald (on his fourth album with the Dan), and heightened writing and performances by Becker and Fagen.\nFlash forward to February 2000:  With little more than hints of the Dan's imminent output from Fagen's \"The Nightfly\" and \"Kamakiriad\", and Becker's \"11 Tracks Of Whack\", all three of which demonstrated further immersion in jazz and complicating the marriage of the melody and the chord changes to a frustrating degree, a little album called \"Two Against Nature\" appears on February 29th.\nMuch like \"Kamakiriad\", this album sat rather strangely with me at first.  The hooks are not immediately identifiable or memorable, yet, upon repeated listening, become embedded in one's own musical palette.  It's not even worth trying to tackle the chord changes until the essence of the tune has been absorbed--and for a tune like \"Negative Girl\", this can be a daunting task.\nIn any case, the album is every bit Steely Dan, albeit aged a few years since the rockin' 70's.  It would have been nice to have heard something akin to \"Don't Take Me Alive\" or \"Doctor Wu\" on this one....something a little heavier, with less of the cycling vocal hooks at the end (didn't need to hear \"how about a kiss for your Cousin Dupree\" ALL those times before the fade-out).  I guess, despite the funk grooves in several of the songs, I didn't really feel the edge.  This incarnation of the Dan is more playful, with lyrics like \"who says today's a fun day\"....perhaps softened through the years.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, though.\nAs far as the studio work, \"2VN\" leaves nothing to complain about.  The Dan, longtime sticklers for studio perfection, have left nothing untweaked in this recent go-around.  Everything sounds beautiful through any set of speakers.  You can be certain that every note, every solo, every ounce of soul is there because the Dan wanted it there.  Hey, they certainly did something right to get the Album Of The Year award!\nDanfan or not, this is one to pour in a glass and take in slowly....the dry humor....the sweet harmonies....  This is a tasty one.", "Sometimes when a company makes a sequel, it disappoints.  But that's not the case with Hitman 2.

But there are certain scents that seem to have a near universal appeal.  Those include vanilla, citrus. cinnamon and musk.  But perhaps the most universally agreed upon agreeable scent is the floral group.  The delivery of a gift bouquet of flowers will always create the desired swoon to the recipient both for the delicate natural shapes and colors of nature, but also for the delicious scents they emanate.  The perfumers at Burberry have engineered a scent in this Brit Rhythm Floral that captures the subtle and sensuous tones of nature in just the right blend and strength to produce a near intoxicating effect.  Subtle but confident it conveys the same satisfying and pleasurable emotional response of inhaling a bouquet of roses and lavender. Light, pure, sensual, clean and natural are some adjectives that come to mind. Pretty and feminine are the next words that come to mind.  This is a scent that isn't reserved for a special niche as in a young business woman, or an evening scent or a mature scent.  It has a universal appeal that any age can wear in any circumstance.  It's neither sweet nor heavy but light and playful. It could easily become a woman's signature scent that a woman could appreciate on herself and her partner would immediately relate to and react to from walks past  gardens and ornate displays in high end hotel lobbies.  The scent is packaged in a bottle with an equally subtle design; a simple rectangular glass with a cut glass textured pattern on the surface and a background pink tint.  Like the scent itself, the bottle isn't overpowering or pretentiously trying to make a loud statement. It perfectly compliments this soft sensuous feminine scent.  Hopefully my description hasn't itself been too flowery, but as a male, I really like this scent and would notice and positively react to any woman that passed wearing it.  Honestly my favorite scent I've encountered in a long time. Again, scent and reactions are relative and subjective, but this is definitely a scent to get you subtly noticed and seen as a feminine, soft and positive female.", "Loves it", "Fiskars normally great quality holds true with these replacement blades in a 3-unit package.

Sandra Bullock has always been one of my favorites. I loved her in so many pictures, such as Crash.  But her voice performance lacked warmth, passion and conviction in this movie.  It was almost juvenile. I was also unimpressed and puzzled by Danny Glover's accent.\n\nAccording to the supplemental information provided by producers and creators of this film, a lot of time and research went into presenting this story with depth, honesty, and integrity.  However, Hollywood has once again reverted to type, and missed the mark.  A much better job could have been done at making the cast as colorful, warm, and authentic as the animated characters portrayed.", "Bright and very eye-catching is the best way to describe this pair. After more news about bikers getting hit by cars, I wanted to increase my ability to be seen during the early morning when I love to ride. This combination is really great. Very visible from a long distance away and the pattern that the rear light traces is very eye catching. I know this because I saw another biker with the same setup and it was very easy to pick out.\n\nInstallation was pretty straightforward. Battery install was a snap. I saw some review complaining about it but it was really quite easy. Mounting was pretty simple but I wish the rear light had an easier way to tighten against the seat post. It is a little tedious to guess the proper angle for adjustment and then move the light back and check it again. But it was not a huge deal if my rear light droops a little.\n\nAll in all it is well constructed and definitely Portland OR rainproof!", "Perfect low profile pot holder for my cast iron skillet!

The clips work perfectly around the trash cans and they are removed before I tie the bags for pickup.", "The transparency is great so you can see what's in there without having to open it or label it.

I have stapled 20 sheets with no problem - using normal 20 lb copy paper. When I want to staple larger amounts of paper, I use it as a desk stapler rather than holding it in my hand = no problem. I was happy with the performance and price - I bought another one for a co-worker.", "Capcom's Street Fighter EX series, developed by Arika, takes the standard Street Fighter 2D gameplay and throws it into a 3D world, adding a few new characters and moves along the way. The original Street Fighter EX fared pretty poorly in arcades, but after a few revisions it found a greater audience at home on the PlayStation. Street Fighter EX2 added a few new moves and characters, but it never really made much of a splash. Street Fighter EX3 takes the gameplay and additional moves of EX2, adds a tag-team element similar to that of Tekken Tag Tournament or Capcom's own Marvel vs. Capcom, and drops it onto the PlayStation 2 for a quick and dirty fighting game that seems a little rushed but still manages to be a lot of fun. The game's main mode is original mode, where you'll pick one character and dive right into a short but sweet fighting quest. Your first match is against three competitors - all at the same time. After winning this, or any, match in this mode, you'll be asked if you'd like to recruit one of your opponents. You can recruit up to three partners as you progress through the six-match quest, which comprises tag battles, team battles, and a two-on-one match. Completing the final battle nets you a screen full of text and the ending credits. The ending credits serve as a sort of bonus stage, where your main fighter is put on the screen with six or seven generic fighters whom you can beat with only one or two hits. The game gives you an infinite combo meter and keeps track of how many of the generic bad guys you can knock out before the credits end. The other fighting modes in the game let you set up tag battles, dramatic battles, team battles, and four-player matches at will. The game's other real bonus is the character edit mode, which is an extention of the expert mode that appeared in EX1 and EX2. Instead of having a set number of missions to complete with each character, EX3 gives you Ace, a generic-looking fighter who looks a bit more like a fighter out of the Rival Schools universe than a Street Fighter. When you first start playing, Ace has no special moves whatsoever - he is a completely blank slate. As you complete the expert mode-like tasks (block all attacks, perform a three-hit combo, execute a combo that does over 90 points of damage, and the like), you earn experience points. You use these points to buy Ace's special moves and super combos, which you'll need to complete tasks later in the edit mode. Once you've beefed up Ace, he'll be able to hold his own in the game's other modes. While the character graphics used in EX3 look pretty amazing when standing still, the animation is the same as it was in EX2. Granted, you can't exactly add lots of frames to all the special moves and keep the game's timing as faithful to the Street Fighter series as EX3 is, but now that the 3D Street Fighters don't look all blocky and pixilated, the jerky animation really stands out. Also worth mentioning is the appearance of B.A. Baracus himself. Yes, what appears to be Mr. T's picture adorns the walls of one of the arenas. It's a strange yet heartwarming tribute to such a master thespian. The audio portion of EX3 is packed with great effects, such as deep, bassy whooshing noises that accompany super-combo fireballs and the like. All of the hits and misses sound terrific, and the character voices are nice and crystal clear. The music, however, doesn't always fit the action. Also, in an annoying demonstration of audio streaming, the music changes tunes on the fly when other characters get tagged in, so you never listen to one song for long - one track fades into another as soon as the action on the screen dictates a change. Street Fighter EX3 is the game that EX2 should have, and probably would have, been, had this kind of hardware power been available sooner. The tag-team fighting adds a nice new element that the previous game totally lacked. EX3 may feel a bit rushed in some spots, but overall it's a fun and great-looking fighting game that won't disappoint longtime EX fans.", "The recording quality here is wonderful on my system, so Deutsche Gramophone did their engineering job as well as one could ask, given what they started with.  My hat's off to their staff; I salute and love their work.\n\nI've listened to these recordings a few time now, and have to say that, with the exception of Symphony #5, I find them a bit too restrained for me (and this strikes me as a general tendency with Von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic -- with some composers and works it's just right, with others, it isn't).  In this case, I won't say it isn't, but for me it doesn't get to the essence of the score.  I admit:  that's subjective.  Those of us who love this kind of music carry around our ideal performances in our minds, and for Four and Six, this one falls short (but I do like Five in this set).\n\nI say that after hearing several major orchestras play these symphonies live and listening to many different recordings of them, as they are among my favorite symphonic works.\n\nStill, there's a lush and pleasant tone and interpretation about these, and if you're the sort of person (like me) who owns multiple performances of the same work, you might like this CD.  I'm glad I have it and will hear it again, along with Solti's and other interpretations.\n\nIt's really a solid, professional performance -- just a bit sedate for me.  If the strings had picked up the energy on the pizzicato on the second movement of the Sixth, I might have changed my mind.\n\nIt is annoying that in this set that #5 is split betwixt two CDs.", "Oh yeah..classic", "Made polishing and waxing my car a breeze.", "Could have come with all the fittings needed...Had to wait since the ford fitting was not included", "I love the message and the music in this song.

What you see here on this Blu-ray is likely the best this will ever look, it's limited by the source material. No amount of baking, scanning and what-have-you is going to do this source material any favours.\n\nThis is also presented in the original aspect ratio of 4:3, meaning on a high definition TV you will have black bars on the sides. This is perfectly normal. If they were to re-scan the source material to present it in 16:9 you'd be now stuck with around 400 lines of source resolution and it would be ugly, so either zoom in on it or please hold your tongue...this is as good as it gets.\n\nNow for the juice - Chuck Ainlay has gone back to the original master tapes and done an amazing re-mastering of Alchemy as well as an amazing multi-channel surround mix, mastering to 24-bit/96kHz and encoded using the dts Master Audio codec, which is of course lossless.\n\nThe surround mix is enveloping and accurately reflects the feel of a live concert. Every single nuance of the performance seems to come across with delightful clarity, from the subtleties of Private Investigations to the all out rock and roll of Sultans of Swing. Until now the best I've ever heard Alchemy sound is on the original German vinyl pressing, but I have a new favourite and it is this Blu-ray disc.\n\nWhether you kick the lights and TV off and flick your receiver into a PURE DIRECT mode, shut your eyes and float away into this amazing concert or watch it at the same time, this one will be sure to be in constant rotation for a long time to come. Alas this isn't the pristine 1080p24 16:9 35mm transfer that I'm sure people would love to see, but with the elements available I think we're very lucky to finally have such an incredible audio presentation of this truly wonderful performance.\n\nThanks Universal Music and thanks Chuck Ainlay...and of course thanks to Dire Straits, you still rock as hard in 2010 as you did in 1983.", "Recommend them highly.

It is now 2015 (coming up on 2016!), and our two original pots are still going strong!  I did order two backup pots, as I mentioned intending to do... as yet, we haven't even opened them.  We're still fonduing away with our original pots.  I can't think of any other small appliance we own that gets used as regularly as our two pots do, and yet still works perfectly!\n\nMy husband and I received two of these pots in February 2002 for our wedding shower.  Yes, we had actually registered for them - we love to fondue.  We're coming up on 10 years of use of the same two pots we were given at our shower, and they are still going strong.  Notice that I am posting this review on New Year's Eve 2011/2012 - we just used them again for an afternoon fondue.\n\nI'd say we use these at least monthly, sometimes more frequently.  They are useful for so many things beyond just fondue, even as a small deep fryer.  I've used them as a backup for my two crock pots when serving a buffet - they're great for keeping soups, sauces and such nice and warm during a lengthy serving time.  I've used them to serve Italian Beef & au jus, warm apple sauce, warm appetizer dips, etc.  They'll keep these foods warm for hours without burning.\n\nI know a few reviews have mentioned the cord - both the length and the break-away safety feature.  A few thoughts on this:  Yes, the power cord is short.  This can be very inconvenient, especially since I doubt most of us have an electrical outlet in the middle of our dining room table.  I know I don't.  What I do have, however, is a surge protector strip with a very long cord.  We set that down in the middle of the table, and securely wrap the cord a few times around the leg of the table before plugging it in.  Then the pot is plugged into the surge protector.  This ensures that no one is going to trip over a dangling extension cord and gives us peace of mind that the draw of electrical power into the pot isn't going to overload a flimsy extension cord.\n\nFor us, it's well worth it given the high quality of this pot and the even heating it provides.  In ten years use, we have never once burned anything in the pot... and trust me when I say that is less because of our own cooking skills than it is because of the high quality of the pot's heating design.\n\nWe've also never had trouble with the breakaway actually breaking away when we didn't want it to.\n\nA few tips:  Don't use metal implements for stirring/serving.  The fondue forks are fine (you wouldn't be dragging them along the interior of the pot anyway), but you don't want your non-stick finish chipping so use only plastic/silicone/wood/etc. for any serving or stirring implements.\n\nWe found that the rings designed to hold forks when you're cooking meats and such are sort of useless.  We just don't use the rings.  On the other hand, we generally only fondue with close friends & family, so we tend to just batter up the meat or whatever and sort of dump it all into the oil or broth.  Then after it cooks long enough, we scoop it out with a mesh ladle we have for our Wok.  Then we just divvy up the meat (or sliced potatoes, or stuffed mushroom caps, or whatever) and pop in another batch to cook while we enjoy the one that just came out.  Your mileage may vary.\n\nThere is a little recipe book included with the pot.  The Swiss cheese fondue recipe in it is to die for, but I'll warn you that your measurements for four of the main ingredients (1 lb of shredded Swiss cheese, 3 level Tbl. flour, 3/4c milk & 3/4c. warm white wine) need to be EXACT.  Even half an ounce off with the cheese, for example, will make the fondue too runny or gritty.  So weigh/measure carefully.  Put the flour in a zip lock bag, add the shredded cheese, and close the bag almost all the way.  Then blow the bag up like you would a balloon, and finish sealing it.  You can then shake the bag vigorously, thus ensuring the cheese is well coated by the flour.\n\nI have also found that it is much more effective to put a teaspoon or two of jarred minced garlic (with a little juice) in the pot and spread it around with a paper towel than it is to rub the pot down with a garlic clove.  This, by the way, in addition to the non-stick surface, helps keep your food from sticking.  You WILL notice a difference when it comes time to clean up a cheese fondue if you've skipped the garlic step.  Major pain in the butt.\n\nIf you do manage to get a food to stick to the surface and it's not coming off easily, fill the pot with hot water and turn it on for a few minutes.  A drop or two of Dawn in the water helps too.  We all know that \"non-stick\" only means \"easier\" not \"slides off like water on a duck.\"  While the water is still hot in the pot, a plastic bristled bottle brush will help with gently removing the food off the pot.  Personally, the only food we've ever had any problem with sticking was cheese fondues that we didn't clean up immediately after use.\n\nThese pots have served us extremely well over the last decade.  We've actually decided to buy two more and keep them in reserve just in case Rival ever decides to discontinue making these.  We do NOT want to be without these pots - they are our favorite small appliance and very much loved in our family.", "Watch it every year.

He believed this was implied by Polynesian legends of  ancestors having arrived from the direction of the rising sun. It would have been possible because of prevailing currents and winds in the South Pacific, which flow from East to West. (The accepted view was that Polynesia was peopled by migration from Asia and Melanesia.) To show his theory was possible, Heyerdahl and 5 others built a balsa wood raft entirely of materials available 1500 years before and set out on the journey.. Amazingly, they succeeded in reaching an island after 101 days at sea.\n\nAlthough the feat did not prove the South American origin theory, it did prove it could be true and had to be considered.\n\nThis fascinating documentary consists amost entirely of film taken by the crew during their voyage.

I haven't read much Historical Fiction so far, but I've been wanting to for quite a while. I was interested in medieval England primarily, and I found the first book really cheap, so I dove in.\n\nTaking place in the 13th century, we are given the tale of the ruthless King John of England, and his greatest rival, Prince Llewelyn of Wales. To gain a hold over Wales, John marries his favorite daughter, Joanna, to the influential Welsh Prince. Joanna wants nothing less, but as she slowly begins to love her father's greatest enemy, she finds herself torn between the two powerful men. The romantic tale is merely a tiny aspect of this engrossing novel. You will also witness the warfare, politics and what life was like during this brutal period of English and Welsh history. I can think of nothing to compare it too except Braveheart, which is high praise from me. This book has everything in it. It's amazing how some of the best stories in the world actually happened.\n\nFrom what I've heard, and from the little I've witnessed, historical fiction usually means there will be a compromise in writing and story.

'Don't Go' is one of the worst tracks in Judas Priest history. The video is also an abomination to the art. Just horrible. 'On The Run' is decent but could have been a lot better.\n\nThis may not be the fastest or heaviest Judas Priest album but don't write the darn thing off because of that. It is one of the most enjoyable albums they ever released and easily one of the best hard rock albums from the early 1980's in a time where all the once great hard rock or metal bands were making the worst music of their career.\n\nPoint Of Entry is worth the price of entry.", "I bought this phone for my Friend she wanted it.

Jazz and rocks fans alike will like it.\nBowie demonstrates again he is not a one trick pony. The man who re-invented his look a dozen times re-invents his musical style.\nI fully recommend \"Low\" by David Bowie. You've got samples here.

Perhaps pre-teens are so in touch with 3D games that 2D games seem brittle, or maybe it's about taste.\nIn any case, I personally recommend Mischief Makers to any gamer who can tolerate mostly-two-dimensional side-scrollers. Not only does it have a female hero (okay so she's really a robot), it's also lots of fun with few complications. There is so much mindless humor, you might go boom. \"Okay, whatever!\" you ask? Right. Did I mention no struggling with camera angles? That's right: no clipping, no awkward views, and no blocky characters.\nThe main character, one Ms. Sarina Lightyears, calls herself an Intergalactic Cybot G! Her creator, one Professor... oh, what's his name?! Anyway, Marina's father/creator has been kidnapped and now she must rescue him from his evil brother and a gang of so-called do-gooders. I don't see any reason not to play this game unless you hate girls or side-scrollers. Give it a girl... I mean whirl! You'll be glad you did!\nOkay, so I promised an updated review and I intend to deliver. I never promised the update would be any good, but here goes:\nWhen playing as Marina (which is usually the case except for the two-or-so levels you play as Clancer), you \"attack\" your enemies by grabbing and then throwing them. You can throw them in one of eight different directions, but it's usually a good idea to act like a school bully and shake them first to relieve them of any gems they may be carrying. You can shake and throw friendly characters too if you feel like being a jerk; they don't seem to care anyway. In fact, Marina likes to throw her creator every time she rescues him, but that's probably because he looks like he's about to cop a feel when he tells her how glad he is to see her.\nThe music is also catchy. I don't think you'll like it, but I certainly do. It's sort of ... actually I'm not really sure what the hell it is. It's good though.\nYou also get plenty of stages on a map screen you can play again as many times as you want. In fact you probably should play them more than once just to get the illusive yellow gems if you didn't get them the first time.\nI wanna say more, but the dogs are yapping at me.

I read the reviews below and started using this camera with some doubt based on a few of the reviews.  I needn't have doubted.  This is a great little camera.\nFirst, to address some of the negative reviews.  The camera is not a battery hog.  It does, however, give that illusion since the battery metter reads empty well before the batteries are actually drained.  If you use the batteries with the built in tester the batteries still register a near full charge even though the meter reades low.  Just keep using the camera until it doesn't flash and only then change the batteries.\nPicture quality is very good.  When printing, as with any photo, be sure to use photographic paper and use the settings the paper recommends.  If you don't use a good paper and the correct settings (the printer won't set itself) the picture will look grainy.  But that goes for any photo from any camera.  Also, take the pictures with the highest resolution setting, not the default setting.\nThe pluses for this camera when compared to others in this class are the macro settings, the large number of photos that will fit on the SmartMedia, the four mode flash, the four resolution settings, the optical and LCD view finders, the second LCD screen for settings, the video cord for displaying your pictures on a TV and the included photo software.\nI think some of the negative reviews come from people that expect this camera to compare to a [$] camera.  Well, it's not a [$] camera but, compared to cameras in this price range, it's a champ.", "What I didn't realize is that I already had one of these cases.

No accidental \"pink\" clothes mixed in with the reds.", "I consider myself a longtime amateur when it comes to digital photography.  I like to play around with photos, but would like to gradually learn more about how to take better pictures, and how to edit them afterward.  AfterShot Pro is the perfect fit for me.  This is not the software you would use to make pixel-level edits but, rather, it is for doing overall fine tuning of a photo's color, sharpness, tone, etc.  In other words, if you need to erase an object from a photo, use something else (Corel PhotoPaint, Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, and others).  But if you need to darken a picture, accentuate the shadows, crop, tilt, etc. then this is a very easy-to-use tool.\n\nHere are a few highlights for me:\n1) Play around all you want...your original photo never gets changed.  AfterShot Pro lets you find a photo and start tinkering with it right away.  It might feel as though you are messing around with your original, but the truth is that all changes get made to a copy.  Basically, you can create and manage multiple versions of a photo without every needing to worry that you've ruined something.\n\n2) Lots of presets that get jobs done quickly.  For example, some of the default presets are \"Bluer Skies\" and \"Deeper Shadows\".\n\n3) You can make a sequence of modifications to one photo, and then copy and apply that same sequence to other photos.  You can even save those steps as your own preset, if you think you'll need them again someday.  For example, suppose you take a lot of daytime beach photos.  After looking at your photos, you realize that in most of them, the color of the sand looks washed out.  Well, make all the adjustments you need to one of your beach shots, and then simply apply those adjustments to the rest of the photos that have the same problems.\n\n4) Lots of advanced features that will be there for me if I move beyond \"amateur\":  For example, there is a \"Lens Correction\" tool that lets me browse through a database of hundreds of SLR lenses to find the one I used for a picture, and it will make small (to me, nearly imperceptible) adjustments to a photo, based on the known distortion that lens exhibits.\n\n5) Quick access to documentation.  Though AfterShot Pro doesn't come with a printed manual, its online documentation is well organized, helpful, and immediately accessible from the program's help menu.\n\nRecently, I saw that there was a good price on Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom 4 (comparable, though not identical to AfterShot Pro in its features, and typically much more expensive).  I was tempted to buy it, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I'm really quite happy with all that I can do with AfterShot Pro.  I believe both programs have trial versions that allow you to test them out for a limited time, so you can compare for yourself.  But at roughly half the cost of Lightroom, Corel's AfterShot Pro is perfect for me!", "I love these pants.  I buy these in various colors and wear them daily for work.

Simply put, Roadwork has got to be one of the greatest live albums ever recorded. From the gospel-tinged \"Save the Planet\" to the raw blues of \"Tobacco Road,\" this recording just grabs you right from the first song and just won't let go. In addition to being an amazing keyboard and saxophone player, Edgar Winter is an incredible vocalist. When you add the incendiary Jerry La Croix, an equally amazing vocalist, the result sends chills down your spine. For you guys who are air guitar specialists, I recommend that you check out Rick Derringer's rendition of Chuck Berry's \"Back in the USA.\" Derringer proves beyond a doubt why he's a legend on the six string. But it's not enough just to have Rick Derringer on the scene. Edgar introduces his brother Johnny for a fiery version of \"Rock & Roll Hoochie Koo.\"There are so many highlights on this recording that it's hard to select just one as a favorite. Certainly one of the highlights is \"Tobacco Road.\" After you've heard Edgar Winter's White Trash work out on this cut, it's just like there's nothing more to be said. If I had to pick just one cut to represent the genius and passion of this album, I'd go with the old rhythm and blues classic \"Turn on Your Love Light.\" Listen as the horns blast out that classic riff and then let Jerry La Croix take you on a trip where the soul of man never dies. This is rock n roll with a vengeance! Or, as Jerry exhorts the crowd at the Apollo: \"If you feel like lettin' it out, hot damn, let it out.\"", "Loved it!

I just stick it in my pocket or around my wrist and I have constant treats!", "It's really no contest for me, but WEIRD SCIENCE (1985) is my favorite John Hughes movie! Is it the best? Debatable, but it is EASILY his most hilariously funny, entertaining, most fun movie start to finish. There is no let up, no slow parts, no wasted moments. Just humorous from the hilarious opening to the equally hilarious closing sequence, in which the film goes full circle.\n\nThe absurd premise of the movie is that 2 barely pubescent horny teenagers 15-year olds Gary (a brilliant Anthony-Michael Hall) and Wyatt (newcomer Ilan-Mitchell Smith), bored on a Friday night while Wyatt's parents are away for the weekend, decide to create a beautiful woman for themselves after watching The Bride of Frankenstein on TV. Using Wyatt's computer, with a little hacking, an Operation Game, a fashion magazine, and a couple of head bras thrown in for good measure (LOL), the nerd duo indeed create a woman, in the form of Lisa (superbly played by 80s babe Kelly McGillis), a tall, slender, voluptuous, savvy, sexy model. The movie also features Chet (winningly played by Bill Paxton), who is Wyatt's boorish older brother visiting while on leave from the military. The comic performances from these actors, in particular Hall (who really owns the movie), McGillis (surprisingly hilarious) and Paxton (who specializes in playing funny a-holes) are completely memorable and are just as funny today as they were 30 years ago. Smith is most obviously the least experienced of the group, but he acquits himself very well and thankfully is carried by the more seasoned trio of Hall, McGillis, and Paxton. Smith kind of breaks the 4th wall and smiles a LOT throughout the movie, but it strangely kind of works given how utterly ridiculous the premise is.\n\nWeird Science also features several funny small roles, in particular a couple of wannabe bullies in Ian (played by the now famous Robert Downey Jr) and Max (Robert Rusler, what happened to this guy?) who terrorize Gary and Wyatt at points throughout the movie, their girlfriends Deb and Hilly (Suzanne Snyder and Judie Aronson) who both Gary and Wyatt have crushes on, an aging punk rock biker gang leader (wonderfully played by reliable 80s bad guy Vernon Wells), and Dino (played by John Hughes' stalwart John Kapelos, who also was in 'The Breakfast Club' with Hall), part of the group of blues brothers who hung out at the bar that Lisa takes the boys too, where Hall steals the show with a drunk Gary acting out singing the blues.\n\nThere are just so many funny scenes and iconic moments in this movie. Some highlights: the opening gym scene, the blues club sequence, the boys first confrontation with Chet, the meeting between Lisa and Gary's parents (my absolute favorite scene of the film), the boys' bathroom scenes at the party, the second creation sequence at the party which results in the funny montage of Wyatt's home getting wrecked (piano girl part is a hoot), the kitchen confrontation between Lisa and Chet where she puts him in his place in a very interesting way. In particular, Hall delivers a genius comic performance as Gary, replete with funny facial expressions, great physical comedy, perfect line delivery, as well as tons of charm. It's one of my all time favorite lead comic performances in ANY film! And as previously stated, McGillis performance is also on the money, managing to make Lisa simultaneously sexy, sweet, seductive, charming, lethal, controlling, and funny. She has more range in this movie than most actresses do in much more lauded films, both comic and otherwise. The scene where she squares off with Gary's stern father, as I mentioned before, makes me laugh my rear end off every time I see it. And as I said before, Smith's contribution should not go unnoticed, especially since he's featured in a lot of scenes. He has several funny moments and it really helps playing off of Hall and his antics for most of the movie.\n\nHughes must have had a ball making this piece. It's easily the most convoluted of his movies, arguably the only one not really grounded in any kind of plot realism or bogged down with overly serious moments. Yeah, there's the awkward, nerdy teen thing and 80s vibe, but this movie truly stands the test of time and is a true comic masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. A lot of people would probably qualify this as a silly, toilet humor, dumb comedy, but that's completely wrong, in my opinion. The humor in this movie is genuinely amenable to many people's tastes and I find a lot of the dialogue well-written. It's not a disgusting, cringy comic piece like a lot of so-called \"laugh out loud\" comedies that Hollywood churns out in today's film. Weird Science is just plain funny and does what a film comedy is supposed to do, make people laugh.", "Bowie is at the height of his powers and process here, much thanks going to producer Brian Eno.", "If you like Christmas movies and haven't seen this one, you are missing out.

The wrench looks and feels well built with well-aligned parts and a handle that slides quite snugly through the body.  Cheaper competitors use springy metal claws that are forced together as you tighten the screw and reviewers complain it gets harder to screw the smaller you force the claws and the screw may strip or loosen as you use the tool.  With this tool, the claws are built like the claws of a drill chuck and there's no additional force required to make the claws small or large.  There are actually only two claws with a triangular notch in each one.  The two notches form a square that grips the tap you put in the wrench.\n\nI assumed when I bought it that \"No 0 - 1/4\" meant it could hold a bit of basically 0 width, but in reality the notches prevent holding anything smaller than 2 millimetres wide.  I'm guessing \"No 0\" refers to a bit of about 2mm because I'm using the tap wrench with a \"No 1\" screw extractor that's about 2.4mm.  It holds the screw extractor well.\n\nIf you need to use this tool often you should probably spring for the ratcheting version of this tap wrench, but for occasional use this model is a great choice.", "These perches are exactly what I needed for my African Grey parrot.

I would've enjoyed multiplayer racing more, if My friend Greg and Jon weren't constantly crashing into things, blaming it on the control.

They started to get a darker edge with their funk laced hit \"Thank You (Fallettin Me Be Mice Elf Agin)\" in 1970. For their 1971 album, There's A Riot Goin' On, the band turned even darker as the album is brooding mix of funk and soul that has a purposely muddy production. \"Family Affair\" is a hypnotic, loping song with a fuzzy bass line that became an unlikely number one hit. Mr. Stone was heavily abusing drugs at the time and there is a drug undercurrent running throughout the album in songs like \"Spaced Cowboy\", \"Runnin' Away\", \"Smilin' (You caught Me\" and \"Time\". The band also looks at the race relations in the country in songs like the aforementioned \"Family Affair\", \"Luv 'N' Haight\" and the slowed down reworking of \"Thank You\", \"Thank You For Talkin' To Me Africa\". On the original album, the title track is listed with a time of 0:00 which is telling. The band saw that there was a riot goin' on in the country, but no one seemed to have any time for it.

I was looking for another to put into an upstairs office which is going to be used more regularly and happened to see this fan on a lighting supply website. After doing some research I decided to get one of these instead of the Hunter for that room. (I did pick up a Hunter for the other small bedroom upstairs and installed both the same day).\n\nThe fan was fairly easy to wire up once I installed a good fan support. It took a little doing to get it pushed up into the mounting plate but once that was done the rest was simple. The blades just snap into place and the light is integral so I just had to install the halogen light and the cover.\n\nMinor quips - 1.) The 100 watt halogen light is not very bright even on full. Granted I replaced a track light with twice as much wattage so I knew I would be giving up some brightness, but I had the track lights on a dimmer and never had them past about 60% so it was equal to about 120 watts. The light on the Minka seems more equal to a 60-75 watt incandescent. 2.) the light cover does not fit close enough to the fan so there is a 1/2\" gap between them and there are 3 metal colored screws exposed. I think the glass cover could have been designed better to cover more completely and would give a sleeker look. 3.) there is a gap where the fan meets the ceiling. Other hugger type fans I've installed have fit more closely without any gap.\n\nThe good - At low and medium speeds the fan is very quiet. With only 3 blades it seems to move a lot of air. At full speed there is some buffeting but no more than any other hugger type fan. The remote works great. I am going to buy the wall switch as the remote always seems to be on my desk when I walk into the room and on the wall clip when I'm sitting at my desk! I wish Minka would put in thier documentation exactly which wall switch is needed. They have several models that all look the same. As near as I can tell, I'll need a WC212. Finally, the fan does look great! It also doesn't seem to be distracting at the lower speeds as the blades are white and there are only 3 of them\n\nOverall I am happy with my purchase and would buy another.\n\nSide Note: The Hunter fan I installed the same day took a little bit longer to install, but only because Hunter gives you 3 options for mounting (2 downrods and a direct coupling for a shorter ceiling). Assembling that took a little more time, but it was easy to install. The light kit was easy requiring a simple plug in connection and mounting the globe. The fan even included 2 CFL lamps!!", "Love this filter. Quiet and economical to use.

The album's divided into fourteen cuts, but it plays as one long blender ride of a record collector's OCD all-night editing orgy.

It's easy to use and has good reach.", "The very best!", "strong, quality product", "As Phil and Co. have stated, \"The Purple EP\" will be the first of four, each to highlight a different element of the band's sound.  This is officially supposed to be the \"heavy\" one, sparking a buzz (so to speak) with Down fans.  All six songs are intended to concentrate on the more in-your-face, upbeat, energetic side of Down.\n\nFor this reason, some are comparing it to NOLA.  That's not a bad comparison, but I'm hearing a little of everything that makes Down heavy.  The first track, Levitation, starts with a slow, doomy crawl, before shifting into an up-tempo metal vibe reminiscent of Down II.  Next, Witchtripper steps up the pace with a Sabbath-inspired headbanger that could've been on NOLA.  Track three, Open Coffins, gets slower, with a mix of doom and bluesy metal that would fit on any Down album.  The Curse Is A Lie continues in similar fashion, with plenty of Iommi-like riffs, some that crunch and others that soar, but with an underpinning of mid-paced doom.  This Work Is Timeless is a true Down stomper; short, sweet, and full of muscle.  The last song, Misfortune Teller is a seven-minute epic spanning nearly every aspect of Down's metal roots.  It's a powerful way to end the first installment of Down IV.\n\nIn the vocal department, Phil sounds like Phil.  He hasn't varied too much on any release aside from dropping the screams that characterized NOLA, and you won't hear many on this.  On Down III, I thought he sounded a little thin, like he'd lost some of the power behind his singing voice.  On this EP, he sounds more like he did on Down II.  The bellow is there, as well as the nuance Phil has always injected, making him one of metal's most compelling vocalists.  Basically, getting this EP is a no-brainer if you like Down, doom, sludge, heavy rock, or metal.  You really can't go wrong with these guys.", "If you want a versatile and useful set of cutting dies these will fill the bill. Although it took me a while to master using the Nestabilities on my Cuttlebug, and an additional purchase of Spellbinders' mats for embossing, I now use these regularly in both scrapbooking and card making. The directions although adequate were rather brief, so I turned to YouTube to understand how to use these. Once I learned how to cut, change plates, flip the die, add the mat and emboss with these dies, the results were quite nice  good clean cuts with a lovely embossed edge.  Also, I purchased the Large Classic Rectangles set as well for a smaller matting edge between multiple layers of cardstock. The large set starts with a slightly larger rectangle than the small set with each rectangle in the large set getting SMALLER.  Yes, the sets overlap, but none of the dies are exactly the same. This system was confusing at first, so I had to go to the web to understand it. Also, I wouldnt recommend inking the die itself to make an inky edge as some suggest on YouTube. I prefer inking or painting the paper after cutting.  Here are my pros and cons:\nCons:\n  Expensive! The price is high and you need to buy mats as well to emboss.\n  Takes some time to learn how to use the system.\n  Need multiple sets for the best effect. It is confusing when you start.\nPros:\n  Makes a nice cut and clear embossed edge.\n  Can be used with Cuttlebug as well as other die cutting systems.\n  Lots of dies are available to purchase and expand your collection.\n  Some of the dies work together to make great lacy edges.\n  Useful!

The combat engine and interface are flawless and jaw droppingly smooth.  Facing one opponent, move the analog stick back and press the square button to whip around and give the enemy sneaking up on you a good kick.  Trapped by more enemies on all sides, vault over one and get yourself some breathing room.  You can freeze enemies with the power of time, you can launch yourself off of wall for a more powerful attack, and you can even get a little help from Farrah, a mysterious woman also spared from the sands of time.\nThe environments are beautiful and richly detailed.  Tapestries move as you walk past, water ripples, and dust falls from the decaying walls of the huge palace that you find yourself trapped in.  The palace is quite large and has many areas to explore, nooks and crannies to check out, and a few secret areas.\nThe game is mosty a straightforward action/adventure quest with a few puzzles thrown in for good measure.  Pulling levers, pushing blocks, swinging from walls and dodging traps are all skills that you will find yourself utilizing in dazzling combinations and myriad situations.  The game is structured to provide a builing block system when it comes to controlling Prince.  Moves are added one on top of another at appropriate times during the game so as to provide a good learning curve...before you know it you will be doing some pretty wild combo moves.\nThis game is awesome!  It is a solid addition to any library and a treat for the eyes as well.  This game is as fun to watch as it is to play and everyone should own it.  This game is what the \"Tomb Raider\" series should have been!  I simply can't praise it enough!

This theme (or group of themes) is found in many episodes of all five (6 if you count the animated series) of the Star Trek universe.  Just to name one from each series, it includes The City on the Edge of Forever, Yesterday's Enterprise, Duet, Timeless and Carpenter Street.  They all involve one or more of the themes I mentioned.

This is understandable since most rpg games, especially those of the fantasy genre, involved defeating a Dark Lord of some sort and saving the world from destruction. This is not the case with ATLUS' Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. Disgaea is one of the funniest and most irreverent game I have ever played.\n\n For starters, the main character in the game is a teenage demon by the name of Laharl whose sidekick Edna is a young demoness who seems to be constantly ridiculing Laharl and maybe even plotting behind his back. Laharl is clueless and behaves the way he thinks demon lords should behave, Edna and the rest of his courtiers barely give him his due respect and yet they still follow him for some reason. Weird and unusual cast of characters for an rpg.\n\n With Disgaea being an rpg in the same vein as Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle Tactics, there will be an inordinate amount of jobs you as a player can recruit to join your team. Jobs that can be recruited from can range from stereotypical fantasy fare like wizard, mage, cleric to more out there jobs like being a gunslinger of some type. There is even a a unit character one can recruit that is nothing but demonic servants in the shape of penguins that are called Prinnies and who always say \"dood!'.\n\n The levelling system in Disgaea is very extensive. If one had the time and inclination to do so, they can level up every character in their team into the 10000+ level. The same goes for the levels of their items. The good thing about Disgaea is that there are certain levels --- I will leave it up to the new players to figure out which --- that helps immensely in powerleveling a team member in the tens of thousands.\n\n The story for Disgaea is funny and doesn't make sense at times, but I think that may have been a plan of the developers from the beginning. But in the end, the story and its many subplots meld well together and everything starts to make sense. The dialogue ranges from downright funny, some sexual innuendoes thats either very mature or juvenile, and to very poignant and sad. I enjoy the option of keeping the voice-over in its original Japanese voices and using English subtitles. Or one can just go straigh to English voice-overs. More rpg games should make good use of this option. It'll save alot of gamers from having to listen to very bad English dubbing.\n\n The graphics is very simple and some may say dated for a PS2 game. It uses anime-style 2d animations unlike most rpgs that have gone the 3D-animation route. The animation looks very colorful and nice even if it's not 3D. The music ranges from operatic to J-pop in styles. Disgaea is really very simple when it comes to its visuals and audio. It could've been done better, but its a minor quibble when taken in context to the rest of the game.\n\n Disgaea: Hour of Darkness is a fun time of a game and one that doesn't ever get old or boring. For gamers who enjoy powerleveling their characters and who like to micromanage every detail of their gears and abilities, then this is a game for you. I hope ATLUS will continue with the success they had with this game and make an even better follow-up.

The expansion of the meaning of the word \"gay\" over time certainly draws some attention to the film. Needless to say it only meant \"happy etc.\" back in the day.\n\nAnother unusual factor is the release year of the film. The first time I saw it was back in the early eighities. The newspaper TV section said it was released in 1952. I have a book by Roy and Dale which lists their films and release year that also says 1952. However another book that goes into great detail about the singing cowboys and their movies says it was released in 1948. That makes since because it features Andy Devine who was Roys sidekick in 1947/48, it has Jane Frazee who co stared in several Rogers features in 1947/48 and the copyright year appears to be MCMXLVII(1947).This same book shows it to have been the first RR release of 1948 which fits the time line perfectly as there is usually a gap between the time a movie is filmed and when it is released. Did the film have a limited release in 1948 but had to wait until 1952 for a general release? If so why?\n\nAnother interesting point is the movie never seems to show up in color in spite of it being well documented that it was indeed filmed in color. Even the VHS sleeve indicates color but this copy is in black and white. Regrettably I may have to assume that this is one of the RR films that was filmed in color but no color copies managed to survive  the brutal economizing of the early TV film editors.\n\nIn summary, this is not a bad Rogers movie and it is in full length certainly a bonus when you consider how many are sold in a cut form.

I wish the \"stop\" function lasted as long as the \"slow\" function, but you can't have everything.  The fighting situations encourage you to use them, too.  Often enemies are way off, and you don't get a sniper rifle until later (and when you do it's best to ditch it soon after the initial use is over for something more appropriate to what's coming), so your best bet is to slow or stop time and move to closer cover.

And playing with time is nothing new, so that hook for this game doesn't dig too deep (ugh, sorry for the bad analogy).\n\nLuckily, the \"crossbow\" gun (no, not arrows, just the way it looks), is especially cool.  It has a zoom scope and fires explosive pellets.  The moment I got it I kept one on hand the entire rest of the game.  It makes the conventional sniper rifle almost completely unnecessary.\n\nOtherwise, though, there's nothing really new or special in the gameplay.  The controls are bizarre at first, too.  There's certainly nothing bad about Timeshift, it just doesn't advance the genre in any way.  It's a very well done but unremarkable shooter and little more.  If you just plain like shooters, it's worth having.  If you're looking for something to really impress, this isn't it.  In it's defense, a thought just occurred to me, though.  Just how many more ideas for a first-person shooter are there?  Maybe I'm expecting too much......", "It bottom cracked after having sand in it", "Not bad... zippers could be stiffer... the stitching on the corners is a bit off causing the zippers to have a tough time around the corners. The padding is a bit too cheap of foam, some denser foam would have been nice. It has a \"seatbelt\" for your keys that is a good idea. (though I put in a piece of foam to protect the center...3 straps would have been ideal). The fabric is good though mine had a big line across the front due to some manufacturing error (not that big a deal as it is cosmetic). The handles have a stiff plastic bar in each loop making the carry more comfortable. The outer pocket has this mesh fabric that is not a great idea as it catches on things.\n\nAll in all not bad but the price is too expensive. I paid around $90 and feel the value is not that great.

The overall theme of the CD is that of a young boy (who is a representation of Marilyn as a child) being forced by a corrupt society and a systematic program of indoctrination and abuse to turn into a horrifying creature.\nThere is a high degree of factuality in the album, especially owing to the song \"Kinderfeld\", which details the young Marilyn being abused by his grandfather (this actually happened).\nThe album succeeds on many levels. It is extremely deep conceptually, with the character of the Antichrist Superstar and how it originated, being based upon the concept of the Overman. Furthermore, the transformation can actually be felt, and as the album rolls along to its tragic conclusion (which is the fictional element of the storyline), you develop such empathy with the characters. The theme of the album, being \"You are your own god, grab the power for yourself and do not let some church make the decisions for you\" is extremely well developed. On the basis of concept and theme, it manages to be one of the most brilliant albums ever.\nHowever, there is one level on which it fails: Music! I do not enjoy incredibly loud music so this album did not work for me on a musical level. In all honesty, it sounds like a chainsaw! The only songs that work musically (for me) are \"Tourniquet\" and \"The Beautiful People\", \"Antichrist Superstar\" and \"The Reflecting God\", all of which are varied in their construction, avoiding endless metal assaults (whilst most of the other tracks are either ballads or guitar-driven metal).\nOverall, if you want music only, than think twice before you purchase this, unless you are a fan of metal music. However, if you are looking for extremely deep, emotional, dark, philosophical and brilliant works, and do not mind having your ears ripped off whilst a sledgehammer is smashing you on the back of the head by the music then I would reccomend this.\nEven though I do not like it much musically, the conceptual brilliance of this album is stunning.", "It was an ok book.

Ah, theres the rub, to coin a phrase, but I am NOT giving Shakespeare 3-stars: rather the edition I have just read, and even less than three stars for the manner in which Amazon displays the editions. It is just flat confusing, and wrong. Since I started my effort to read all of Shakespeare, at the pace of one work a month, I have been purchasing all the works for Kindle reading. The edition I purchased does have a cover which corresponds with the cover (currently) displayed on Amazon  the statue in the fountain, with the portico in the background. But the edition is (maddeningly!) incomplete  the last few pages are missing! At least the confirmation was comforting  a couple other reviewers gave it a 1-star review  for incompleteness, and not because they were forced to read it. And who could quibble with that?\n\nThen there is the matter that at least two other hardcopy editions are displayed on the same page, and the editorial reviews that are associated with the Kindle edition seem to have absolutely nothing to do with the edition since they speak of copious and concise explanatory notes et al., with the other review mentioning appendixes that relate to Plutarch, Montaigne, et al.  And none of this exists in the edition I purchased, admitted for only 99 cents... but still. If this was a page on Wikipedia, there would be three separate whisk brooms, with the admonition that this page needs to be (really!) cleaned up.\n\nOh yes, was there an actual play involved in all the above grousing?  Definitely, and I must have read 95% percent of the complete play, which poses its own sort of dilemma in terms of recording the play as read. It is yet another classic story  historically based  of power, corruption, intrigue, and death. The death of Julius Caesar marked a key transition in Roman history, from Republic, in its faded forms, to Empire.\n\nAs with so much Greek and Roman drama, Shakespeare commences with a prophecy warning of the ides of March. A prime plotter against Caesar, Cassius, brings in Brutus (of et tu? fame) and seeks the respectability of bringing in the silver hair of Cicero. There are refreshingly modern and straightforward details such as Cassius relating incidents from his youth together with Caesar, a swim in the Tiber (in which the latter almost drown) to an illness in Spain, all proof, he says, that Caesar is not a god. There is a discussion among the plotters about killing Mark Anthony too, but then the consensus is that it would be too much like a butchery, and not a seasoned excise of this ugly boil upon the Republic.\n\nCaesar is killed, literally on the floor of the Senate, obviously long before those ubiquitous metal detectors. He is killed half way through the play, so the remainder is devoted to the (naturally inevitable?) falling out among the plotters, including a key division between Cassius and Brutus. Anthony performs a brilliant funeral oration, that seems to argue on the justice of the killing, but actually turns the tide against the plotters. He allies himself with Octavius, who would become Emperor.\n\nAt one level, an exhausting read of intrigue and perfidy that makes hanging chads a much preferable method for power transitions. Who would have thought Id say that? The plotters do lose out in the end... if I only knew what that actually end was! 3-stars, reflecting a triangulation between an excellent play and an incomplete edition that did not live up to its advertising.", "You want to offer your assistance to nearly everyone you know,...

As I opened the book , I was amazed at the likeness of the serial killer's mo to Dexter and unfortunately for the first few chapters I couldn't get Dexter out of my head as like Dexter - The Undertaker is a clean killer , he lies them on a steel bed that kind of reminded me of a hospital gurney, straps them to the gurney and uses a surgical scapel to kill them , Using a surgical scapel can always result in two ways - a sharp , quick death or a slow and painful torture depending which arteries or veins you slice. As a mystery fan , I found The Undertaker to be a great read as the novel was fast-paced and kept the reader thrilled as I'm not one of those readers who like too many details in my murder mysteries - The Undertaker was more James Patterson and Jeff Lindsey rather than Karin Slaughter and Patricia Cornwall in writing style.  The Undertaker begins with a computer technician reading in the paper one day - a death notice for him and his wife , however he doesn't mind his name used though he is eager to find out why, but using his wife's as she died a few months ago by Cancer and Paul Talbot is still grieving . As the novel reads on we see Paul team up with Sandy , who becomes Paul's girlfriend of sorts to try and get to the bottom of this and clear up his and his wife's name. The odyssey takes Paul and Sandy into a whirlwind world of corruption, politics , danger and finally murder. As the two get deeper in , can they find themselves a way out or will Paul and Sandy fall victims to the serial killer known as \"The Undertaker", "Three years ago I chuckled to myself when many reviews stated that this Hot 1 would only last about 3-4 years.  Last week, right on time after just over three years I woke up and found that my Hot 1 had leaked water all over the kitchen floor and cabinets.  The leak came from the unit itself and not the connections.  It is literally broken and will not hold water.  Not too bad of a spill but it did cause me to have to stay home from work to clean the mess and that took a few hours.  All that said, while it worked, it was great and delivered hot water on demand.  I guess I will buy another one since it will be easier to install it given my limitations under the sink.  Oh well.  Three years and a new one.  I gave it three stars because it was affordable and reliable while it lasted.  If it was still working I would give it 5 stars.  These units should last at least five years IMHO.\n\nEdit:  After writing this review, insinkerator contacted me and offered a few possible solutions and a hefty discount on a replacement.  Nice to know some companies still value customer service and go the extra mile.  So, my review still applies but the company gets five stars for service!  Thank you!", "The story is pretty generic. A great cop gets inplicated in a scandal and mysteriously disappears. His son has a few issues as a result, leading to violent behavior and a bad attitude. Still, he becomes a cop just like his daddy, trying to do the right thing or get revenge or something. Later on, an ancient Chinese ghost and a few zombies get involved, but it's still not a very good story. At the end, there's a lesson about what the \"true crime\" in LA is. Wouldn't want to spoil the amazing plot, though.\n\nEven with the sub-par storyline, and the fact that this game is an obvious rip-off of Grand Theft Auto, I had fun with it. While there are similarities to GTA, like fighting, shooting, and driving your way through the city, there are some differences in how it's done. You could say that True Crime puts a little more finesse into those elements. When you fight, you can high kick, low kick, punch, or grapple. A bit more complex than GTA. Then you can learn various moves including running attacks and special grapples. This makes combat more difficult, since you have to remember how to use these attacks in order to win the more difficult fights. I had trouble getting past a few fights, because the enemies had high life or they were really good at blocking.\nThe shooting is more challenging and yet more interesting, too. You can just pull the trigger as fast as you can, but if you're up against a whole mob of baddies, that'll just get you killed. So, you can duck behind objects and take shots from your cover, dive out and shoot Matrix-style (Jeez, can't Rockstar come up with anything on their own?), and aim for critical areas of the body. You can upgrade your skill so that you can make a head shot or a neutralizing shot more easily. So, you can use some techniques other than the old \"bring a big gun and try not to die\" thing. Speaking of guns, you can't just buy them. You have to pick them up from criminals. The type of gun isn't as big of an issue, and there aren't cheat weapons like the cool ones in GTA.\nAnd then there is driving. As with fighting and shooting, you can upgrade your driving skills. You can learn to do a \"peel-out\" or to ram a car the right way so it goes spinning, among other things. You can also shoot and target while driving. You can even blow up cars in one shot by targeting below the license plate. Sounds fun, huh?\n\nAs I mentioned, you can just shoot at a criminal, perform a head-shot, or neutralize him by going for the arm or leg. Why would you waste time with a leg when you can just blow his head off? (By the way, you don't actually see it blow off. It's not a bloody game.) Well, there is a point system. You get Good Cop points for putting as little hurt on your opponents as possible, and Bad Cop points for trying to kill people (shooting at civilians, shooting criminals in the head, etc.). You get different endings for good or bad ratings, and the happiest ending is for good cops. It's up to you how you want to play it out. You can choose to load an earlier chapter and get a different ending, so you can be bad then be good, if you want.\n\nThe music in this game was pretty good. There was some rap and hip-hop, and some heavy metal in the more intense scenes. The graphics are average. They aren't ugly, but they aren't beautiful. As I stated, this game isn't too graphic. No bloody stumps, no splatter of brains on the sidewalk. But there is some sexual content, such as strippers and talk of 'family jewels'. None of it is that bad, though.\n\nThis game does have a few problems. First, there are glitches. You might fall through the ground and get stuck in a gray zone if you walk in the wrong place, or have some skippy dialogue in a cut scene. Second, the controls aren't smooth. When you're fighting, it may feel like your attacks are slipping right by the enemy. It can make the battles iffy, even if you have the skill to win. Another issue is that the scenery appears when you drive near it, rather than reaching all the way to the horizon. Some things don't appear until you're twenty feet away from them, which can cause you to run into things. You think \"I'll cut through the grass to save time\" and then \"Crap! Where the #%*! did that wall come from!?\" Some walls don't even when you run into them at 100+ mph, and it's a real slowdown having to reverse and go around, not to mention you lose all the speed you built up.\n\nOverall, I had a good time playing this game. There are little sidequests and alternate plot endings, which gives you more to do. The game is twenty bucks now, and that's a pretty good price. I'd say that this is up to a thirty dollar value. So, if GTA or games like that are your kind of thing, and you want to try the other side of the law, pick up True Crime: Streets of LA.", "Let me start by saying after Crazy Taxi, Tony Hawk 2 has the best video game sound track.

I have been gaming for a long time (92-01). In all my experience I would have to say that Tony Hawk 2 is the hardest sports game to be 100% complete in. If you can not unlock the cool stuff you will just have to use cheats. The graphics by todays standard are medicore. I reccomend to rent it first before buying it.

The music is authentic slick eclecticism, tho more in variety of instruments and instrumental riffs than in genre.  Lyrically, it is heavy in stream of consciousness, but Ray has interesting things to say and uses some appealing images, what with an album title (and song) like \"Golden Scarab\" and other song titles like \"Solar Boat,\" \"The Moorish Idol,\" \"Whirling Dervish,\" and \"O Thou Precious Nectar Filled Form.\"  The best moment is Ray's great electric piano soloing and the driving beat on \"Downbound Train,\" reminiscent of The Doors' \"Black Train Song\"/\"Mystery Train\" concert renditions (see The Doors Box Set).

There are  some tight tracks like their remix of T.Corp's \"Shaolin  Satellite\", but the whole of the album bores me.  My suggestion is  that if you like ambient albums that are also interesting and inventive,  \"Sessions\" is a MUCH better choice.

Nevertheless, they always brought some basic memories of my days feeling the rhythm of the arcade. That was there with Pac Man. The arcade classic still seems to amaze me from time to time. But, when too much nostalgia seems to simmer around, it is just so difficult to decide. Especially, whether there is the system you own, or the quantity and quality oddly enough, it always comes down to the simplicity of the yellow chomp, and the ghoulish spooks that haunt him. The downside is that there is ultimately too many different ways to get Pac Man.\nThe 2004, Pac Man for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, is a consistent enterance, as it was a few years ago with the Pac Man Collection. This version of the game, was made in response to the Classic NES series lineup, a collection series to the 20th anniversary of the original Nintendo Entertainment System, the original super-system, of all video game systems. There really isn't anything new here, as you've played Pac Man here, but the game itself, and its reissuing again. The game features Pac Man, trying to gobble the power pellets, and evading away from the ghouls, that strike at will. The downside is that it really isn't useful, when too many reissuings of Pac Man are all at one, only one should be chosen, and stuck with.\nAlthough Pac Man is great, this isn't the best version of the chomper that is yellow. Instead, I suggest you get the Pac Man Collection edition for the Game Boy Advance.

A young man named Erik is growing up in a village, unacknowledged son of the noble. After an incident he and a friend Roo are sent to be hanged and instead told they will be spared if they train as special soldiers to fight an unknown menace approaching from another continent.  Not much of a choice but they accept.\n\nAn evil magic-using force on another continent is pushing an army to take over cities along a major river. When the force reaches the river estuary it will besiege and occupy the shipbuilding city.  At this point it will be able to make an armada to sail across the ocean and conquer Midkemia where Erik lives. He and the squad of trained soldiers are hoping to delay that event and give the continent time to prepare for war.\n\nIf we just stayed on those lines all would be well, but the author insists on bringing in several different scattered characters who, we suppose, are from previous books. There is a dozy young man with a magic sword, who does nothing at all for most of the books.  There is a magic user who can't be bothered doing anything as he is waiting in an alternate dimension with a charming woman until it's time for war. So on.

It charges fully in a little over an hour.\n* You can take a decent number of pictures without having to recharge the battery. I took about 95 at the 2048x1536 resolution in the fine mode on my Canon S30 in about 3 hours of shooting time and that was with the display on. If you turn the display off this time will be extended significantly.\nNegatives:\n* The charge does not last very long, usually less than a day. This is why that spare battery is mandatory.\n* The NB-2L battery is very limiting. It can only be used with Canon S30, S40, S45 and S50 Digital Cameras & Elura 40MC Camcorders. I could understand if it could be used with the whole line of Canon digital cameras but no, it can only be used with those models. The other Canon cameras have there own batteries such as the NB-1L. I don't know why this is. Maybe it's a money thing with Canon.\n* It's expensive. Though the price has gone down significantly from when it was first introduced a few years ago, it's still costly. Since you must buy a spare battery, it's hard on the wallet to buy one of these let alone two.\nOverall if you have any of the above model cameras you will need this battery even with all its flaws. The fact that this battery takes little or no time to charge is indeed the upside.

They do have some merit - they can dish up a chugging energy and (then) guitarist Bob Stinson can wail. They wrote some good songs and they can play ballads. But too many of their songs share their same ole basic sound  and Paul Westerburg's vocals are too ragged and spasmodic for my tastes - I just find them rather unappealing (and this review is, after all, about my opinion). The pianos in particular are rudimentary, sloppy and out of tune.\n\nI guess this is one of those cases where \"you had to be there\" since their live shows were so legendary (although you had to catch em on a good night as there was the distinct possibility they'd be too drunk to play). This music does lend itself well to drunkenness and it sounds like they were drinking when they recorded it. I'm more of a stoner so that may be part of the problem right there.\n\nAs usual, it all comes down to a question of taste, so if you love this album and I tee you off, feel free to give my review a \"not helpful\" vote. It just doesn't do much for me, but I do like to write and spew my opinions, good and bad, so there you go.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n\"I Will Dare\" - upbeat, rather happy, almost sing-songy (think nursery rhymes like \"Mary Had A Little Lamb\"), countryish yet still messy-sounding due to the band's trademark style. I don't like \"sing-songy\" and I'm not much for country. Still, I admit the song IS catchy and Peter Buck's (R.E.M.) solo is good. ***1/2\n\n\"Favorite Thing\" - more propulsive than the previous tune, twangy in places, Westerburg shouting. **1/2\n\n\"We're Comin Out\" - has a thrashy bent. Stinson goes off the hook. The quiet section at the end sounds a little aimless but it works up to a great climax. And I like some of the lines - \"One more chance to get it all wrong.\" ***1/2\n\n\"Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out\" - cool the way it starts out thrashing then abruptly changes into a catchy slower tempo. And it's punk rock short. ****\n\n\"Androgenous\" - beloved by many, a very good song, but I don't like it due to Paul's crappy vocals, its sing-songy quality and the pathetic piano, especially the way it craps out in the end. ***\n\n\"Black Diamond\" -a KISS cover and a pretty faithful one. KISSucks. Whatever punk credibility they may have had went out the window with this song (at least according to those who keep track of such things). Actually, this is an appropriate cover since both bands play plodding, rather tuneless rock n' roll. OK, the Mats are more melodic and much better but there ARE similarities. Maybe they covered this one to show how unpretentious they were. **\n\n\"Unsatisfied\" - probably the best song on the album, it has crisp guitar, a very heartfelt delivery from Paul and the lap steel is a nice touch. ****1/2\n\n\"Seen Your Video\" - an instrumental (until some vocals at the end), some decent rocking and playful guitar parts plus some more cheesy piano thrown in. ***\n\n\"Gary's Got A Boner\" - I really don't care if Gary's got a boner, but the title tells you a lot about the band - they have a really juvenile sense of humor. This one's a bit too similar to \"Cat Scratch Fever,\" another basic, average rock song. This track gets elevated a bit higher when Stinson goes off. He's one of the main ingredients that made this an above average rock band. Minus 1 star for ripping off Ted Nugent. **\n\n\"Sixteen Blue\" - another contender for best song, it's slow and melodic with emotive guitars. ****\n\n\"Answering Machine\" - this is actually a very cool song, performed solo by Westerburg (on guitar, vocals and percussion). Great guitar tone and the verses create a feeling of excitement. As usual, I don't find the lyrics to be quite as affecting as they're meant to be. (\"How do you say goodnight to an answering machine?\" Uh . . . goodnight?) The worst thing about this song is the operator's voice at the end which is really annoying. That may have been the point but it doesn't make me want to hear it. Minus one star for that. ***", "The scariest thing to come out of Japan since Pink Lady, The Grudge tells the story of a young woman who travels to Japan with her underwear-sniffing boyfriend and soon finds herself in the clutches of an evil curse (as if having an underwear-sniffing boyfriend wasn't bad enough).

I found Delorome earthmate to be better than Microsoft Streets and trips for these reasons:\n(1) Better live navigation - The voice and guidance from Delorome is way better than MS streets & trps\n(2) Delerome is 3D presentation while MS streets & trips is just 2d presentation\n(3) Delerome costs $39 while ms streets & trips cost $54 - at the time of this review\n\nMicrosoft streets & trips v/s Online maps - google, yahoo, MS live\n==========================================================\n(1) Good - MS Streets is way faster than any of the online maps\n(2) Good - MS streets does not need internet connection unlike online maps - literally works everywhere\n(3) Bad - MS streets & trips requires you to upgrade every year for updated map information and POI (points of interests) such as restaurants, gas stations, while online maps do not need you to subscribe to any updates\n(4) Bad - Online versions contain street view (in google), birds eye view in (MS live) and satellite view (in all online maps) while MS streets and trips does not contain any photography\n\nMicrosoft streets & trips v/s Portable GPS units (Garmin/Tom-Tom) ...\n==========================================================\n(1) Good - MS streets & trips can be viewed on a larger screen on your laptop v/s tiny screens on a portable GPS units\n(2) Good - MS streets & trips costs much lower than portable GPS units\n(3) Bad - Portable GPS units are far more portable, easy to view(can be fixed on the windshield) compared to MS streets and trips\n(4) Bad - Portable GPS units are more user friendly with easy to navigate interface and touch screens while MS Streets and trips requires use of computer keys which can be distracting as well as cumbersome\n\nSafety concerns:\n================\nLastly I have a few safety concerns about using this product on your laptop while driving\n(1) Unless your laptop is fixed well into the car - it can be flying object hazard.

I was largely disappointed with the previous novel because of how overwritten, long-winded, and lacking of true shocking moments that makes this series.  Although A Dance with Dragons suffers from some of these issues as well, its not quite as severe as it was in the previous book.  However, this novel definitely could use some serious editing.\n\nThere are parts that drag on endlessly with no seeming rhyme or reason.  There are also some story lines that don't seem terribly relevant.  Among them is anything featuring the Greyjoys and the Iron Isles.  I just didn't care about this story line and feel that it doesnt add anything to the story.  The same is true with the emergence of Aegon Targaryen and Jon Connington.  It just feels added on and not essential.  There are already plenty of people vying for the throne.  To add this one cheapens it.\n\n Its hard not to make a comparison between the novels and the HBO show.  Early on in the series, I found the books to be superior, and now I think the show has surpassed it.  An example of this is that I like the direction of the Tyrion Lannister character my favoritein the show as opposed to what he is doing in this novel.  The same is true with the Arya and Sansa storylines.  One of the great episodes in the past season of the show was the battle against the White Walkers at Hardhome, something that never occurs here.  I also liked how the show portrayed Daenerys escaping from the fighting pit.\n\n Thats not to say that there aren't very good things about the novel.  George R.R. Martin is a master of prose and is a skilled writer.  There were some big moments in the novel such as Jon Snows fate and Cerseis walk of shame.  Its just that I feel with some serious editing the novel could have been much better.\n\nCarl Alves - author of Two For Eternity", "If you are a fan of Bon Jovi or even just like a few of their hits, this album is for you.

The only way to find it   he  says  is by reading a cryptic poem containing nine clues from  his  self-published 2011 memoir  \"The Thrill of the Chase.\" Part of the poem reads  \"Begin it where warm waters halt / and take it in the canyon down / not far  but too far to walk / put in below the home of Brown.\"\nA former military pilot turned wealthy antiques dealer   Fenn  told ABC News the main reason for creating this massive treasure hunt was to give people hope.\n\"In 1988  I was diagnosed with what everybody thought was terminal cancer  \" Fenn  said. \"But besides that  we were going into a recession  and lots of people losing their job  despair was written all over the headlines  and I just wanted to give some people hope.\"\n Fenn  claims  he  hid a bronze chest filled with gold coins and rare artifacts.\nBecause of the fluctuating price of gold   Fenn  said  he  isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure of the exact value  \"I don't even want to think in those terms. Writers about this treasure hunt have appraised it between $1 million and $5 million.\"\n Fenn  told ABC News  he  estimates that nearly 350 000 people have gone out searching. The treasure could be hidden anywhere in tens of thousands of square miles of territory out West  from New Mexico to Montana. Aside from the poem   Fenn  has given few clues as to the treasure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whereabouts  but he says the treasure isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anywhere dangerous.\nSome skeptics think it's all a hoax  but  Fenn  is quick to defend its authenticity.\n\"The treasure is real \"  he  said. \"The treasure is hidden where I put it.\"\n Fenn  said thousands of online forums  videos and documentaries have fueled speculation  with people obsessively pouring over  Fenn 's prose-prompted clues to the point where  he  said  he  has received the occasional death threat.\n\" This one guy  called me...  he  said  'Tell me where the treasure is right now. I'm going to kill you.'\"\nSo far  no one has been able to find it  including Washington state resident Dal Nietzel  who has made more than 65 search trip since  he  started looking in 2011.\nNeitzel runs  Thrill of the Chase  a popular blog documenting  his  own quests and the quests of others. It also serves as a fan page for other  Fenn  afficiandos.\nCynthia Meacham  also among those looking for  Fenn 's treasure  said she first found out about the treasure in 2013 and has made more than 100 trips near her New Mexico home.\nThe quest for  Fenn \u00e2\u0080\u0099s hidden treasure comes with multiple dangers  including bears and rough terrain. Several people have gone missing or died trying to find it.\nIn 2016  authorities found the remains of Randy Bilyeu  whose family said he too went missing while searching for  Fenn 's treasure.

This was back in the heyday of the Commodore 64, when Infocom was king. Those people really knew how to tell a story and make puzzling fun. Then the graphics revolution came, and adventures became more about pretty pictures than actual adventuring. I got tired of paying $40-50 for games that looked lovely but bored me. DOOM came along, I got into first-person shooters and I never looked back.\n\n Well, I might have peeked once or twice. That's how this game caught my eye. It was reasonably priced compared to what I was used to seeing, and I remembered reading positive things about it.\n\n I've found that not much has changed.\n\n In this game, you play a lawyer named Kate Walker (an appropriate surname, since she does an ungodly amount of it) who has left her job to assist an elderly toymaker named Hans Voralberg in realizing his dream: that of reaching a legendary island called Syberia, where mammoths still roam. Basically you are his errand girl, making deliveries, doing maintenance, and retrieving items because he's too infirm to do it himself, and his robot companion Oscar is too timid and absolutely refuses to go out into the cold. Will Hans make it? Will you end up wanting to tell both Hans and Oscar to get lost and hightail it back to New York? I won't spoil it for you.\n\n (I hadn't played the first SYBERIA game, but that was okay because this sequel - or continuation, really - comes with a cinematic recap.)\n\n SYBERIA II is easily the most beautiful game I've played to date. The setting, a remote area of Russia, is a veritable winter wonderland, and the attention to detail is superb both in the graphics and sound. Snow slides off roofs to land with a satisfying \"floomph,\" wildlife roams or flies in the background, old structures creak. Kate makes footprints that disappear as more snow falls. It all contributes to an atmosphere so enveloping that I forgot that I was playing it in the middle of summer. There are also some amazing and truly cinematic linking sequences.\n\n The gameplay, however, is another story. The game is heavily scripted, which means you spend at least half the time talking to various characters. Repeatedly. In many cases, several times in a row. It's a very awkward and tedious way of moving the plot along. Why not at least have the conversation continue automatically rather than make the player keep clicking over and over again? As for the puzzles, they aren't so much difficult as simply obscure. At one point, you pick up a cleaning brush. (Why? Because it's there.) It's used to scrub away part of a painting in another room to find a clue. But why would anyone do that, or even think of doing it? There's no indication that the painting is relevant, unless you happen to run your cursor over the hotspot and see it change. That's just one example. A lot of the puzzles require you to pick up random items that seem to be of no significance, and which are very easily overlooked - and then do incongruous things with them.

In terms of sheer charm, the original wins hands-down, but the 1980 remake must be commended for re-creating the tale for a new generation.\n\nWalter Matthau and Julie Andrews manage to conjure up some sort of chemistry--but despite that fact you'd never imagine them as a romantic couple.  Sara Stimson is appealing in the title role, and there are some fun cameos from Tony Curtis and Lee Grant.\n\nUniversal has released LITTLE MISS MARKER on a bare-bones DVD--fullscreen transfer, and there isn't even a menu.  However, the price is nice, and the movie itself is quite enjoyable.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).", "I'm torn about this game.  For the most part, I don't really have fond memories of it but memories of frustration; which is quite unusual for me.  I've actually had this game since I was very young.  If a game is hard enough (it must be extremely difficult for me), I can get tired of playing it and put it down, as well as forget about it, for several years. Then, later in my life, I dig it back out to complete it (often my skills have improved since I last played).  So, in that respect, it occasionally takes me years to complete a game.  I'll give you the cons and the pros in that order.  Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether or not this game is even worth your time.\n\nCons:\n\n1.  This game is one player only.  This isn't a problem to me, as a solo gamer; but I know many people like to play in groups or with a partner.  This especially hurts this game in fields relevant of today's; where almost everything is designed for the possible participation of at least four people.  I'm just warning you about this upfront.\n\n2.  No ending.  There is no ultra secret ending; it's all an over-hyped disgrace.  You have a door that requires at least one hundred power cells to open it.  You literally go from that you-know-what-hot-place and back to get one hundred of those stinking power cells only for a white light that the characters awe over.  You never even know what the white light belongs to!  Don't bother completing the game one hundred percent for something better either.  It doesn't work; that's all you get.  This made me so Hoover Dam mad!  They had absolutely no right to yank our chains like that.\n\n3.  Repetitious music.  Even upon hearing it for the first time in years, I'm sick of it.  It's okay at first; but even to begin with, the music could be better.\n\n4.  Various control quirks.  Jak looks horrible when he's jumping (like some deranged bird trying to fly) and his double jump doesn't even work if you wait even half of a second too long.  This leads to a lot of unnecessary deaths by falling.  Also, camera controls are just awful; it can get pretty difficult when your camera is determined to stay in one angle, when you need it to go into another.  This causes even more deaths by falling.\n\n5.  Hard and Frustrating.  Remember all of those deaths by falling I mentioned earlier?  You'll probably go through thousands of those as well as get lost a thousand times.  Have a stress ball or pillow ready, or you may break your game through your urge to thrash it.  Adding to this frustration, Daxter can occasionally be an annoyance (a cocky coward who's all talk).\n\n6.  Various glitches and somewhat poor level design.  This, combined with Jak's terrible jumping ability, can make this game a complete nightmare.  Look around online for more specifics on the glitches (thankfully, I don't think I've encountered many, if any) but trust me: they won't make your life easier.\n\n7.  Overused enemies.  You pound a lot of the same creatures, even over the course of different areas.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Beautiful graphics.  nice, lush backgrounds pertaining to forests, beaches, caves, and towns.  They use good graphics for lost cities, the citadel (which is like the final level), and labs too, but those can be a little repetitious.  If you take a few minutes to watch the sky in a natural environment, you can watch the cycles of day and night with the sun, stars, and moon.  Although it cycles slightly too quickly, I think that's the most impressive part of it.  Oh, bear in mind these graphics are slightly cartoonish.\n\n2.  Decent plot.  It's also very simple: Jak and his friend, Daxter, are exploring someplace the Green Sage told them not to go.  While they are exploring, they find a pool of dark eco, a sinister and black element harmful to all creatures.  After they find it, they are spotted by a villainous sentry which initiates a battle.  Jak fight while Daxter hides behind him; but the force of Jak knocking out the sentry causes Daxter to fall in the dark eco.  Daxter comes out, but soon realizes (and screams) over being transformed into a cute and furry little ottsel.  They return to the Green Sage, who scolds them for going where he told them not to go.  He's reluctant to help, eventually slipping the information that he can't help anyway: only the White Sage can help.  Now, how and where do you find him?  That's where the journey begins.\n\n3.  Comical/interesting characters.  Most of the characters are funny.  In the earlier stages of the game, Daxter will say something funny every time Jak passes out (gets defeated on land), even to the point of insinuating that Jak's breath smells.  Also early in the game, the Green Sage scolds and screams at them like crazy; which is also funny.  Sadly, at the later points of the game, these jokes go away making some of the characters seem serious and out of material (which isn't overwhelmingly) much).  That doesn't mean there aren't any more interesting characters: Kiera, for example, is a female inventor of sorts that will make various crafts for you.  You'll also bump into a sculptor looking for his muse and even a guy wearing a barrel.  The sculptor and barrel wearing guy, however, are characters that can only be spoken to a limited number of times.\n\n4.  The fishing minigame is fun.\n\n5.  It's addictive at first.\n\nConclusion:\nThat's all I can really say.  This game had the potential to be excellent, but it didn't quite hit the mark.  Those with a lot of patience will enjoy it the most.  Don't give it to younger children unless they're really skilled; or they won't enjoy it.  You can buy it if you want a real challenge (that has quirks), or if something here really appeals to you; but other than that, there are better platformers out there.", "https://t.co/gwGuQNpVg8After #Capture #ISIS  #Militants By #IraqiArmy Seen What Happened Next #Russia #USA #Syria #SyrianArmy #America", ". . err ... it has it is ups and it is downs", "Light-hearted, fun, quick read.

Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like this controller, there is a negative for every positive.  I mean that quite literally - for every good feature, that feature also has something wrong with it.  I noticed all this after only 1 day with it:\nLayout - the positive is that the Rumblepad is nearly identical to the Playstation's Dualshock controller.  There are 7 buttons, 2 triggers, 2 analog sticks, a d-pad, a shift button, and even a throttle slide!  For many games, you will not need to use the keyboard when you've got this gamepad.  However, the Rumblepad is different enough from the Dualshock that if you are trying to play Playstation games on your PC (Final Fantasy, Metal Gear, bleem!, etc) you will have some relearning to do.  You might want to wait until Sony starts making USB Dualshock controllers.  (which should be in 6 months)\nFeel - this gamepad is nice and big, and doesn't cramp my large (adult male) hands at all.  However, the buttons are terrible!  They are tiny, hard to press, harder to reach, and even harder to figure out which one you want without looking at the pad.  I can't simply rest my thumb naturally on the buttons, but have to bend it akwardly and press the buttons with the very tip of my thumb.  This is a design flaw of the pad, not because of my particular build, which is quite average.\nAnalog Sticks - these are both very responsive, and perfectly positioned.  The negative is that they don't have a good gripping surface or shape, so your thumbs don't stay centered on them.  Because the sticks are curved inwards, (console sticks on all major systems are curved outwards) I often find I am controlling the stick by its very edge, which is uncomfortable and very inaccurate.  As if by the Hand of God, you usually won't need to repositon your thumb until you reach a particular important part of your game!\nUSB - this speaks for itself.  USB is great, if you don't know yet.  You can unplug the pad and move it off your desk easily.  However, this gamepad requires a -powered- USB hub.  You can't plug this into your keyboard USB ports.  Great if you already own a powered hub, but if you don't that means you either spend another $ on one, or you plug it into the back of your computer case (thus defeating the ease of USB)\n(as of Oct 2000, the Rumblepad doesn't work well with Windows ME.  I downloaded the latest update from Logitech, but my computer locks up whenever I plug the gamepad in.  I have to have my computer off to plug it in.  However, this might be caused by the power requirements of the Rumblepad, not the software.)", "I needed to learn the basics to start using my new Air Fryer -- recipes were good but I wanted to know how to cook things I had on hand...basic instructions that my Air Fryer instructions were less than complete about.

Yes, I used a pan of water under the meat.

The electronic element died and I replaced it with one that died.

Put my meat over the pan and let 'er go.  Cost me under $5 for this solution, doesn't require any additional grills on my patio and produces amazing smoked meats.

I like Terry Gilliam's past work. `12 Monkeys' was a great movie, and `Brazil' is in my top five all time. I also like Johnny Depp. He is great in almost every role he takes. Unfortunately the combination of Gilliam, and Depp did not deliver in `Fear and Loathing'. I'm not sure exactly if it was the story, or the directing, or both, but the movie seemed pretty pointless, and convoluted. I was able to pull a couple redeeming messages from the film though. The downfalls of searching for salvation in drugs was clear. And the superficial nature of modern American materialism also crept in. But I can think of better ways to convey these messages than two hours of rambling, vomiting, hallucinating, nonsense. Overall the movie gets three out of five stars based simply on the reputations of the cast, and the director. While poorly conveyed, the messages of the film also helped keep `Fear and Loathing' from earning only one star.

I did read about a couple of bugs though, so was willing to cut this game some slack and just wanted to enjoy the Vampire experience again.  However, the game is really clunky, by which I mean less than smooth.  The first clue to a lower quality product was in the opening cinematic when there is a scene of 3 vampires walking away from an execution, and their bodies don't move up and down - they just sort of float away.  If this were a vampire trait fine, but it appears to be the programmers taking a shortcut. . .  Also, the game needs to load new levels very frequently.  Go into a building or down a staircase, etc. and you can expect a new level load.  Two or three loads per level would be ok, but 6 or 7 to get from one side of town to the other is too much.  The environment is also much less interactive than in Halflife 2.  When you go beat up some drug dealers, you can't break any of the lab.  Hitting the table where they are making the drugs just brings a smashing sound, the table is intact, and the drugs on the table stay undisturbed.  Likewise, don't count on any windowbreaking, as the window will just show damage but not actually break if you hit it.  Finally, the voice acting is not great, but is less of an issue.  The subject matter and character stats, experience, etc. are good, but the design issues drag down the enjoyability of the game.

I have SRAM x-7 shifters, and X-7 Derailleurs.  I put everything on the bike, and the chain kept skipping.  I realized that it was skipping on the highest (smallest) cog.  I thought perhaps the small cog was not on right, or was not tightened enough, so I checked these things and it was fine.  I kept adjusting the der. and still the same skipping.  It was very frustrating.  I had a hunch that the der. hanger may be bent on this bike, so I purchased a new one (over $30.00).  I put it on with no changes in shifting. The only part of the drive train that I had not replaced was the rear der. I thought that this had to be the problem.  I purchased a new x-7 rear der. (about $50.00). I installed it and it still skipped the same way. UGGGGG!!!! I thought about it some more and decided that something may be defective with the highest gear.  I was going to put the old small cog on and see if that may fix the problem.  That is when I realized that the lock ring seemed to be bit large and was partially covering the teeth!  I looked at the old lockring from the cassette I removed (also a SRAM), and it was considerably smaller.  I used it and it fit like a glove, and did not cover any of the teeth. I put my bike back together, and the problem is resolved!!  I am a bit peeved though because I bought a hanger and a rear der. that I did not need to replace.  I wish I had thought about the small cog before purchasing parts, however, since something is brand new, it should work.  I want to email SRAM and let them know about this issue.

Unlike all the other GTA clones where you play a thug looking to make money and street cred, the goal of the story in Just Cause is to topple a corrupt President's regime.  And like most Eidos games, this one is full of bugs that can ruin the fun for meticulous players.\n\nPositives: The environment is huge, and there is plenty of help from the agency to help you get around.  Parachuting and hijacking helicopters is very satisfying. Although side missions are pretty worthless, liberating settlements and cities is challenging and rewarding.  The main story missions contain enough variety to keep you coming back.  Graphically, the tropical setting looks very convincing and eye-pleasing.\n\nNegatives: The environment is huge, but very empty.  Besides the capital, the cities and settlements are disappointingly small and all look the same.  On top of that, the main story only contains about 15 missions (possibly due to budget constraints).  Almost the whole western half of the nation is not used as part of the story.  It seems kind of strange that you can finish the story while only a fourth of the country supports you.\n\nNow the bugs deserve a separate paragraph.  Eidos never released a patch or update, so even with newer hardware, the game will stutter and lag after playing for a while.  Graphical artifacts are very noticeable when you are not busy.  Object rendering is okay, but when you are flying, the game easily gets confused over whether to render certain things or not.  The most frustrating bugs in this game are with the AI.  After completing a mission and the police stop chasing you, helicopters may still fire at you and continue to follow you.  On many occasions I would get run over and killed by an ally at the worst possible moment.  As you progress through the story the police and military go insanely aggressive with explosives.  If the AI decides to starts firing rockets (which is often), you're screwed and have to reload the previous checkpoint.\n\nDespite all these flaws, I really enjoyed Just Cause.

Even draw-in on some objects is worse than older GTA games on the PS2. It is painfully obvious that this title was designed for the Game Cube and was way behind schedule, and therefore, an allowance or requirement for a Wii-port. I think for those claiming that the graphics are great are comparing them to the 10 year-old technology of Ocarina of Time, which really isn't an objective assessment. Since the Wii is supposed to have twice the horsepower of the first XBOX, I should at least see XBOX 1 quality graphics.  Most games on the XBOX 1 graphically blow this game away. Certainly even the higher end PS2 games are superior in graphics quality.\n\nGame Play - What is up with still utilizing Z-camera reset? Holy smokes I feel like I am playing Mario 64. You do get used to the controls after awhile, especially if you just played OoT  or M64 on the VC, but why? The controls still feel a little sloppy and not even incrementally tighter than OoT. Why do I still have to go into a \"first-person\" mode to look around when 3rd person action titles have allowed full camera control for years now?\n\nStory - Though hokey at times, the story has a more welcome darker edge. Still, nothing new here. You start out as young Link in the forest and you still have to visit the Gorons. For goodness sake they couldn't have come up with something new? The transformation to a wolf, though looking cool, is pretty gimmicky with little substance in its deployment of fetch and puzzle missions.\n\nSound - OMG, they still utilized MIDI technology. I have to wonder whether this was purposely done for nostalgia sakes. I am ok with a lack of voice-acting as employing Japanese voice actors usually results in horrible outcomes; but they could have used orchestrated music. This is a Zelda title after all, which usually means plenty of innovation. In fact, I started up OoT on the VC the other day and have to say that the MIDI music in that 10 year-old title is better.\n\nOverall, it seems that the designers used the actual OoT game engine from 10 years ago, refined it a bit, and made it passable on a Game Cube. It is certainly not passable by next-gen standards in any shape or form. You can't say that the Wii isn't capable of next-gen technology either. Start up Mario Galaxy and you will see what I am talking about. I still recommend playing this game, as it is fun and engaging, especially if you don't mind 10 year old game technology.

Oddly, my issues with this version spilled over and fouled up the 2006 version when I rolled back. Not all is bad, but there is not enough good here to keep me in the ranks. I'll talk about the good first, then discuss the bad.\n\nI like the fact that Trend offers 3 installations per license, and this was a strong motivator for my upgrade from the 2006 version. With 2 computers immediately in use and another running a dual-boot config, the license scheme is a good option for me.\n\nInstallation is smooth and painless. I never had any issues with installation and I was up and running very quickly - typical of Trend's installation process. Loading software should ALWAYS be simple and straightforward, and Trend has always provided such an experience to me.\n\nCompared to the 2006 version, the interface is visually more appealing. This is largely cosmetic.\n\nMost features of the suite are not appreciably improved, with the notable exception of the antispam component. With the 2007 edition the antispam has taken a large leap forward, in my case achieving a near 100% accuracy rate. This alone gave me serious reason to think long and hard about leaving Trend for another product.\n\nNot everything is good with the 2007 edition, however. On one system, I experienced the massive slowdown about which many have complained (the culprit, by the way, is the antivirus component). On another system, there was no issue. The system with the problem was an AMD64-based system, whereas the other was an Intel P4 system.\n\nI experienced another annoyance with the program which ultimately led me to decide on a new solution. Even though I had purchased a license and was covered for many months, about every 3 days Trend would complain that I was not registered and that I needed to submit my information to ensure that I was legal. Both of my installations were doing this, and when I would enter my email address again I would get an email from Trend that I had assumed the registration from myself and was no longer the registered user.\n\nI downgraded to the 2006 version, with which I had had excellent results, and the registration issue continued on both computers. After fighting with this for several weeks, I uninstalled from both computers and loaded up Panda Internet Security 2007.\n\nAfter 3-4 years of good packages and reviews, Trend let a lemon out of the lab with their 2007 edition. I cannot recommend it.

Gradually she makes friends, until the worst news comes - her dad has been killed.\n\nLook out for the late great Vincent Schiavelli, the lawyer who comes to inform the boarding school headteacher that Sara's father has been killed.\n\nSara gets kept on as a servant and is made to do some awful work.

Too hard to keep up with some of the plot lines and missing a lot of important people, I just couldn't get into it like I could the others.  If you haven't read the first three books please don't waste your time with this review.  Start at book one or be hopelessly lost.\n\nWhen last we heard of them Daenerys was conquering people, Jon Snow had become the head of the Crows, and Tommen was ruling with his mother close beside him.  And many other people were doing many other things.  In this book, we are introduced to several new characters and even get a glimpse of Tommen's sister and her life, although only a glimpse.  Cersei is ruling for Tommen and not taking kindly to those who would oppose her, she's hatched several new plots and none of them kind.  Sam has left the wall to travel with Maester Aemon and a girl called Gilly so that he can join the Citadel and become a Maester himself.  And Arya has crossed the sea to Braavos, where she isn't sure what fate has in store for her.\n\nArya is probably the best character in this book.  I was ok with her before, but really, her story is the most interesting here.  We hear nothing of Tyrion and Daenerys, who are my favorites.  I know they're supposed to be in the next book, but perhaps a mix and smattering of them here would not have been out of place.  As it is there were a bunch of new characters added that I just didn't care about and who really didn't add to the story for me.  Maybe they'll serve a purpose later, but they just made the book tedious as is.  Cersei continues to be unlikable, but we always need a good villain I suppose and she fills that role well.  Likewise, Petyr is always walking that line between good and bad and I can't figure out if I like him or not because of his cunning.\n\nThe plot was all over.  With the amount of characters and the lack of major battles or plotlines, I just couldn't keep track of anything.  And it seems like we were told about things more than shown them in this book.  There are a good several woundings of important characters and we hear about them after the fact, which is unusual in these books.  Like all of Martin's books there is rape, murder, violence, torture, regular sex, and everything else that could make people cringe.  It's not for those people who like their books tame and might even offend a few.\n\nI'll continue reading of course, but I just didn't like this book as much as the other three I've read.  It served its purpose for continuing the plot along, but not as enjoyably as the others.\n\nA Feast for Crows\nCopyright 2005\n684 pages\n\nReview by M.

I was intrigued by this book, and there were some really great things about it, and some really poor things, in my opinion. *Spoilers* So, what I liked. The whole idea of the shadow vampires really intrigued me. It was something new from what I'd read before, and I thought it was an interesting twist I'd love to explore. The sisters were drawn well, and I had a great idea of who they both were. I liked that the author didn't overdo it on descriptions, but kept that at a good pace.\n\nThe reasons I didn't love this book were first and foremost how she fell so head over heels in love with him, when she'd spoken less than 20 words to him. That is a huge pet peeve with this type of book. I love the romance, but I want to see some development before she is irrevocably in love. I also didn't like how depressing she was in the beginning. I know a lot of girls feel this way, being outcast, and having someone in their life who seems to get all the glory, but it went on for about 5 chapters, and even if I were her family, she'd annoy me too. I did like how she got stronger and gained confidence, and I think the author wanted to show her going from a wall flower to a strong woman, but it was just a bit over the top for me. The final thing was that you wouldn't even know it was about vampires unless you'd read the description, because you don't find out til the very end.\n\nThere are a few heart pounding moments, and there weren't a ton of spelling errors, just a few here and there.

The premise of the great seemed like a winning combination of role playing elements and combat. The end result was a little boring and repetitive. Gladius is not that bad of a game - just time consuming.\nBefore you can really be able to play the game, you will spend about an hour going through an extensive training session that teaches you how to play. The game developers were kind enough to include every single instruction on gameplay into the game, so you don't even need to open the included instruction booklet. The problem this creates is you have to keep reading screen after screen of mostly redundant or self-explanatory instruction. Occasionally, the characters onscreen will have pointless mini-conversations that only slow things down more.\nThe game is played by going to different towns and fighting in their arenas. Some fights have entry fees, but the rewards are much greater if you win. After you have fought and won several smaller fights, you may compete in the town tournament. If you win that, then there is a town championship. With each fight you win, your respect in that town will increase. Higher levels of respect get you better prices on equipment and more choices for recruiting more gladiators to fight with you.\nYour characters gain experience after each winning battle. Like any other RPG where you build up your characters, each level gained brings you more abilities and options to learn skills which help you in combat. The game also features 4 different nature Affinities: earth, wind, water, and fire. Choosing to follow a certain Affinity allows you special moves and more damage with weapons favored by that Affinity.\nOnce you make it past the obligatory training sequences, you will be able to walk around the land and visit a bunch of other cities and towns that have their own arenas and gladiators. Each environment and the included opponents are different, bringing some degree of variation to the game. However, combat is basically the same no matter where you go.\nCombat in Gladius is turn-based, but most of the combat area maps are so small that there isn't really any room to develop a strategy. It comes down to moving and attacking and moving on. Whoever is strongest wins and that's pretty much it. You do have some skills and things you can use to best enemies, but you can guess the outcome of any battle just by looking at the average level of your opponents. All in all, combat plays like a glorified board game.\nThe name Gladius rhymes with the word tedious. That's called irony. Each combat session requires you to watch a 10 second overhead view of the arena at the start and end of the battle. This combined with loading times makes each fight take about a minute to start, not counting the actual combat. During combat, you get to see the same animations over and over again so much that you ignore them. When it comes time for your move and you choose to attack, your only interaction is a swing meter than functions like what is used in a lot of golf games. You have a bar with some markers on it and you try to hit your X button when the fast-moving cursor goes over certain markers. It couldn't be any more simplistic.\nAll in all, Gladius is actually kind of fun to play. I am one of those people who obsess over games where you can level up your characters, so I keep making myself play just to see how much I can build up my people.

It's made for a difficult read at times because every time you get interested in what's going on with one character (and Martin is good at getting you interested!) he drops that story and jumps you to another. Most of his chapters do end well, leaving you wanting to know what happens next, but by the time the strand of each character's adventures picks up in subsequent chapters, you've all but forgotten what was going on and need  to re-orient yourself in the larger tale, even as you know you will lose the strand in the chapter you've just completed.\n\nThis seemed to work satisfactorily in the first three books, despite the distractions it created. But by this, the fourth, it's really become a ponderous weight on narrative momentum. Also weighing this tale down is its shift in focus to what had previously been an array of secondary characters -- and the unfortunate tendency the author has of doing many of them in, just as they've really started to earn the reader's attention and sympathies. Moreover this tale is so tangled and drawn out that the various skeins never seem to tie back together into single narrative cloth. The characters are still chasing their tails around Westeros, coming and going to King's Landing where the increasingly vicious Queen Cersei is making a mess of things in the wake of the death of her father, Lord Tywin and her son King Joffrey in the last book and the refusal of her brother Jaime to resume his supportive role in their relationship after his mutilation by the slobbering mercenary leader Vargo Hoat. Faced with his own mortality and confronting his own past failings, Jaime has begun to reassess his life and doesn't like what he sees. To make amends he befriends his one-time guard and captor Brienne of Tarth who had been commissioned by the late Lady Catelyn Stark to exchange him for her captive daughters. But events on the road played havoc with that plan and Jaime eventually finds himself in charge of the Maid of Tarth. Seeking to regain his honor, he releases her to find the missing Stark girls, to fulfill the oath he had sworn to Lady Catelyn when she freed him. But Jaime, still a man of war, is eventually dispatched back to the battlefield by his vindictive sister Queen Cersei when he refuses to resume their former relationship with him in a supporting role.\n\nMeanwhile, little Arya Stark has made her way to Bravos by ship, after escaping Lord Beric's outlaws and the Hound, and there falls in with a religious cult of assassins who apparently promise to train her in their ways, building on the abortive fencing lessons given her by her one time Braavosi fencing master Syrio Forel who may (or may not) have died in the first book. Arya's had a tough time of it since Yoren smuggled her out of King's Landing, falling prey first to one group of marauders then another and always trying to find her way back to her mother and brother but never managing it.\n\nAt the same time older sister Sansa Stark, still the dumbest character in all of fantasy literature, has finally been \"rescued\" from her captivity at King's Landing -- only to find herself part of an elaborate game set up by Littlefingers who is busy manipulating the players at King's Landing from a distance to make himself the real power in Westeros. Stupid Sansa is quickly enticed into Lord Petyr's schemes because he's nice to her (it doesn't take much more than that to fool this gal who manages to fool herself most of the time without half trying) and because she fears just about everyone else. She even takes to the deceptions Littlefingers inducts her into, eagerly accepting him as her father. Of course it was Littlefingers who betrayed her real father into the hands of Queen Cersei, costing Ned Stark his head (although in fairness it was actually stupid Sansa who confided Stark's plans to the Queen and thereby enabled Cersei to act before he could).\n\nJon Snow, Stark's bastard son and now Lord Commander of the Night's Watch at the ripe old age of sixteen (maybe seventeen, depending on the time line), has sent his fat pal Samwell Tarley south to Old Town with blind Maester Aemon and Gilly, Craster's daughter and wife, to seek aid from the maesters in the Citadel while King Stannis Baratheon and his mad priestess of R'Hollar establish themselves in the north along the Wall in anticipation of the coming invasion of the White Walkers. Rumors of a young queen of Targaryen blood, and of her newly hatched dragons, have begun seeping westward from Slaver's Bay in the East and various players in Westeros begin to think the route to power lies through her.\n\nIn Bravos Arya bumps into Samwell, who's been temporarily marooned there with his little party, but neither say enough to one another to figure out that they can help each other though Samwell is an emissary from Arya's half-brother and holds the secret of the survival of her two younger brothers. Back in Westeros, Brienne meets up with Arya's old traveling companion, Gendry the blacksmith's apprentice, and guesses his secret which even he doesn't know and almost manages to tell him that he is a bastard son of the late King Robert Baratheon, but is conveniently interrupted just as she's about to spill the beans by the arrival of old enemies. Brienne, a homely maid of powerful physique has chosen to become a knight, in the face of the unchivalrous derision of the noble knights she has known, and manages to prove her honor and nobility in this volume by running around in circles in search of the missing Sansa and Arya, albeit to no avail, and finally chooses honor over surrender when faced with the ultimate test.\n\nAnd there's a plot to kidnap King Tommen's older sister, Princess Myrcella, whom Tyrion Lannister had previously sent to the Dornish Prince Doran to foster while, among the Iron Isles, the Ironborn choose a new king after King Balon's death, and embark on a campaign of plunder and rapine in the absence of the king's peace. At the Red Keep, Queen Cersie lurches from plot to plot, alienating more and more of her supporters including her father's brother, Kevan Lannister, who refuses to help her son King Tommen when she won't step aside and return to Casterly Rock as Lord Tywin, her father, had planned. The queen, convinced she is, herself, the rightful successor to her late father proceeds to elevate sycophants and lackeys while scheming against those around her out of a growing paranoia. But as one of her aunts tells Jaime late in the book, at the seige of Riverrun, Lord Tywin did in fact have a son who was his match in wits and boldness but it was neither Jaime nor his ambitious sister, but the dwarf Tyrion who slew his Lord father to avenge a great wrong the man had done him.\n\nThis book suffers from an overabundance of storylines and somewhat less interesting characters than its predecessor volumes. Worse, it's less focused than the others and, unlike its predecessors, each of which ended solidly, even if they still left you up in the air, this one seems to end in a whimper. A brief afterword from the author promises more to come but it seemed out of character, the author attempting to win us to the next volume by explicit promises instead of the suspense of the plot. Although the disparate storylines have generally held my interest this last book proved more chore than pleasure by the end.\n\nStuart W.

The idea is simple: take the intensely realistic, scripted action of \"Call of Duty\", throw in some squad based action (\"Full Spectrum Soldier\"; \"Republic Commando\"), add some Spielberg-esque attempts at narration and drama, and voila, the most over-hyped and underwhelming WWII action/shooter in history!\n\nThe GOOD: Nice Graphics (though not up to \"Far Cry\", \"Doom 3\" or \"Half-Life 2\" standards or even close); the game does present some tense, gritty and realistic moments; the voice acting can be pretty good (though it can also be cheesy and bad).\n\nThe BAD: Lather, rinse repeat.  Here is the game in a nutshell: you are walking around with your squad.  You spot a german machine gun nest.  You order your buddies to lay suppressing fire on them.  You walk around the convenient hedge/building/car to surprise the idiotic enemy and you try to pump them full of lead.  The game is fun for the first few missions because its strategic element is new, but once you realize that it's pretty much all the game has to offer... Well, let's just say I went back to playing HL2.\n\nThe aiming is another casualty of the \"realism\".  In an attempt to make you feel like you were really in the French countryside hunting Nazis, your weapon will bob and weave (presumably to simulate \"real\" aiming), you have no crosshairs (though you can insert them through the options menu) and your rate of fire is slow.  There seems to be two camps when it comes to this game: those who love its \"realism\" and accuse the haters of simply liking unrealistic shooters, and those who can see through the hype and cheesy gimmicks (and that's what this game's realism is, a gimmick) and see the flaws and tedium of this game.\n\nThe UGLY: For all its realistic tendencies, this game magically revives your squad mate after every gunfight.  How convenient!  The enemy AI is mentally retarded (gee, a flanking maneuver!  Never would have expected that!) and the main narrator sounds like an idiot.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: I'm not against realism, but this is still a game, and there are certain conventions that exist because they make games more enjoyable.  Sometimes games try to do away with those conventions (save anywhere, good mouse-look aiming, etc) and they usually fail, because at the end of the day... we are still playing in front of a monitor with a mouse and keyboard.

The 2112 epic (side 1 on the vinyl LP, for those who don't know from vinyl) has nothing to do with futurism, contrary to appearances...it is a criticism of 1976 pop culture(the priests) and the impassive music media (Temples of Syrinx and their great computers) that had no room for alternative ideas.  In the song, the pundits are defeated by Rush, metaphorically, at the Grand Finale when \"Attention all planets...\" is iterated 3 times (one time per member of Rush, get it?).\n  There are other sub-interpretations within the song as well...In the plotline, the protagonist suicides after his guitar is destroyed and he dreams of a better world he'll never see under the rule of the priests.

I've played tens of thousands of games of pinball and never have I seen a solid steel ball bounce around like it commonly does in this game.  Plus, many of the so-called \"pinball games\" are actually not pinball, but other types of amusement games.  However, this is still a pretty nice package.  The newer release, \"Williams Pinball Classics\" dramatically improves on the gameplay physics, but suffers from bugs that will crash the game while you're in the middle of it.\n\nThis game suffers from a number of serious problems.  First and foremost, there are bugs in the code which will cause pinballs to disappear or get stuck and you will lose your game.  I didn't like this in the real world and I can't imagine the designers intended the software to emulate this behavior - it's annoying, especially if you're in the middle of the challenge - kiss an hour's worth of time goodbye.\n\nSecond, and perhaps most importantly, as a pinball aficionado, I wax nostalgic for all the old games and many of these I've played in real life.  And it brings back a lot of memories... bad memories of how profoundly bad many of Gottlieb's machines were.  Some games are simply unenjoyable to play.  There is very little skill involved when in at least 1/4 of the games, a significant percentage of the time the ball will drain before you can even get a flipper on it.  I don't blame the programmers.  I blame Gottlieb for designing machines that eat money and are only worthy of being in a bar played by drunk people who don't care. But on the PSP, this becomes an exercise in frustration.  The Williams version is dramatically better and shows how superior Williams pinball games are.  The developers could have done much better with virtually any pinball company other than Gottlieb.  I look forward to Stern and Bally versions -- anything is better than the eternally frustrating tables in this game.\n\nThird, the game physics seem to alter depending upon the view.  This is not a figment of my imagination.  There are some targets I can more or less easily hit depending upon the cam view.  This does not happen in the later Williams version. The developers definitely had some problems in this game they fixed in their newer Williams release.  Some of the machines, like Tee'd Off are an exercise in frustration to play, as some essential targets to hit in order to complete the table goals seem almost impossible to complete, due to some bizarre program logic that makes the ball go in one extreme direction or another.  You cannot execute any reliable ball-flipping accuracy in this game like you can in the Williams version.\n\nIf I could take this game back, I would.  It has been more frustrating than entertaining and fun.  It reminds me of my worst pinball experiences, playing unforgiving tables that required more dumb luck than skill, and malfunctioning machines that ate my quarters.

I do like how well it holds the Wii itself.\n\nEdit: 9 months after originally writing this review, my opinion is exactly the same: it works great for holding the Wii, but I'm forced to carry a second bag to hold the extra controllers so several people can play.  (I also prefer not to force the power cable into it)  If you're getting this, you'll want to also get a ribbon to put under the Wii console so you can get it out more easily; it fits very snugly.  That is, in fact, why I continue using this case: the Wii is very well protected.\n\nEdit 2 (June 2009): Last year I switched to the Wii G-Pack Console Organizer case and prefer it over this one; it does a lousy job of holding games, but a great job of holding everything else.", "I bought this product as a replacement for my VIZIO remote control.

Those comfortable with MS Word, Excel or OneNote should  examine the benefits versus the drawbacks of using WordPerfect and Quattro Pro as  primary applications. Version X8 is stable, lightweight and less resource-hungry than Libreoffice. I found it to be slightly more responsive than Some of the Office 365 apps like Word and OneNote. I have not had reliable success converting Word or Excel documents to either Wordperfect or Quattro Pro. Quattro Pro interprets formulae and functions in its own way so excel users may have to relearn everything. On the other hand, Wordperfect is a stable program . Three stars because this version has few additional features and has not really changed much. What does Corel say?\n\nHere's what Corel claims is \"new\" and worth the price:\n\n1). 3 Templates (one each) for formatting a document in APA, MLA or University of Chicago format. These are available in the Perfect Expert application and must be downloaded before using them.\n2). \"Enhanced reveal codes\" adds an additional button to the WordPerfect Toolbar and the ability to display the codes panel on either the right, left or bottom of the text editing window.\n3). \"Enhanced Undo\" allows a user to  reverse up to 100 (10 default setting) previous actions including undeleting text or reversing a hard return.\n4) Configure specific hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts for your own use/preference.\n5).\"Template Preview\" allows a user to see a thumbnail image of a finished template in the create new template menu box (File=>New from Template).\n\nOf these features, only the APA/MLA templates and the ability to move the codes dock are new in this version of the Suite. The actual functionality of reveal codes remains the same as in previous versions. Moving the codes window from bottom to either side is a hassle when writing.\n\nI do like this upgrade and would definitely say it is worth a look (but probably not a \"buy\"). It is good for me. Users of Microsoft Office and other modern suites should be careful before jumping in and buying the product. The following are some slightly negative aspects of WordPerfect X8 Home and Student (may not apply to the professional edition):\n\n1). No PDF or Legal functionalities. A document may be printed to PDF (as in any other program such as notepad, wordpad) but there is no way to import a PDF.\n2). Collaboration features consist of importing a file to WPD, comparing the document to another imported document and then exporting both documents back to the original format to be sent back to their original source. Another painful hassle.\n3). No features for direct collaboration with Word, Kingsoft or Google Docs/Drive (direct collaboration only available for other Wordperfect users/document)\n4). No mail/calendar feature.\n5). No support for MacOS.\n6). Cannot directly view or edit an HTML document or interpret XML code for editing (without compiling a specific Document Type Definition and creating a new template specifically for that XML type)\n7). Only two legal templates (one memo and one numbered sheet) and one project template for creating a legal time sheet.\n8). The reveal codes pane is very unattractive in \"Classic mode\" (WP DOS mode) and makes for a very cluttered screen.\n9). Word and LibreOffice formats do not convert accurately. Basically, you can destroy an entire Word or Libreoffice manuscript by converting it to Wordperfect and/or converting it back again.\n10). Customizers will spend hours with the XML project designer just to get basic work done\n10). No eBook formatting.\n11). No cloud-based version of the programs, cloud storage and syncing or blogging features.\n12). No support for 64-bit processors.\n\nI recommend this release for long-time or established users of WordPerfect but would not recommend it to users most familiar with application suites like Word, Excel, Outlook/Kingsoft Office/LibreOffice. Conversion to Word and odt (LibreOffice) is fair to poor and the conversion/import process has the tendency to mangle formatting and add extra characters and symbols to formatted lists, text with headings and even basic formatting like a 5-space indent or italicized or bold  text. In long documents it is very difficult to hunt down all of the extra characters and errant formatting and to correct each instance of a conversion error.\n\nI totally understand the religious following of this product and I understand the feelings, but everything gets down to \"Do you want workable skills for a job?\" If the answer is no, the fiddling with Wordperfect and Quattro may be for you.\n\nI am presently using WordPerfect X8 Home and Student for my daily work on Windows 10.  I do like Lightning (notetaking app). Home and casual users may find WordPerfectX8 interesting for the attractive new program icons (a blue circle for WP and a green circle for Quattro) and some of the new templates.\nThe Brainstorm mini-tutorials are fun and entertaining but not really crucial for production purposes.", "Extra large is more like a large.", "RT @Firmabfitness: The four staples http://t.co/2uQfXpPpKk", "I've used one of these at my friend's and it's not worth 30 bucks.

I just pour 2- drops in the cap then dip a very small paintbrush (the brush hair part is only about the size of a long grain of rice. I only use this brush for my nails) and apply it to my nails. The first week or so it stings the skin mild to medium when it gets on the skin. If you wipe the skin with water this really helps take away the sting on the skin. Another thing that helps is put lotion around the nail before you apply the oil. The lotion reduces/removes the sting. Either way the stinging goes away after a week. It is not that bad and it lasts about half an hour if you don't wipe the skin. I have only tried it for a short time with oregano oil and peppermint oil (which has menthol) and it does look like it is healing the nails some.

A set of D'Addario 10's cured that straight away (or whatever you prefer just change them). The tuners aren't the best but they are not to blame, it's the cheap strings. Now, technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box. The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it. I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut (Never had to do this to the nut on an electric, not even on a used guitar. The nut slot was cut too deep), as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable. It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most I've ever had to use. After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws. In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.\nIf I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal.

These beta versions if you will on the way to creating the perfect warrior are aptly named \"The Imperfects.\"  Makes sense I suppose.  Anyway Roekel sends out his Imperfects as well as an army of alien warriors to trash New York City in search of his escaped \"Perfect\" warrior.  Though the voice acting is good, the story isn't really thrilling or important or long but it serves its purpose and gives us an explanation of EA's new Imperfect characters which for the most part borrow powers from the Marvel heroes themselves and though some of them are cool they're not very inspired.  Their origin movies are probably the most entertaining part of the story mode.\n\nGameplay: 2/5\n\nWell this is why you're here and unfortunately this is the area of the game with the most issues.  First off EA decided to do things a little different from its Capcom predecessors.  The game is on a full 3D plain with completely destructible environments.  The first problem is the lack of a lock on feature, making targeting and attacking your enemy an annoyance.  The game is also designed with a fairly unique combat system using only one attack button and the back triggers as move modifiers however this means all characters have the same moves and anyone could pull off all of the moves their first time playing.  The combat system is about as deep as a puddle which is terrible if you're a fighting game fan but works fairly well at letting just anyone jump into the game and play it and possibly win without needing to be a pro.  The problem is this also causes the game to get old very fast because once you master one character you've quite literally mastered all of them.  Another issue is the game becomes reliant on the environment to win and just chucking debris at people will hurt them a lot more than it should, add to that almost everything is explosive.  Winning can be as simple as just item spamming more than the other guy and fights quickly degenerate into games of catch.  The characters also tend to be imbalanced, melee characters like Wolverine are at the mercy of more ranged characters like Iron Man and stronger characters can lift more items giving them more ammo to throw at their enemies, ammo that the weaker enemies can't catch.\n\nThe biggest issue however with the gameplay is no doubt the single player story mode.  It's an essentially mindless brawler that has you play through short episodes with each character.  You go around fighting generic alien baddies in massive hordes, occasionally doing some ulterior objective that involves destroying something and once in a while having a boss fight which is where the real fun lies.  The gameplay is repetitive and as a beat'em up it's mediocre at best.  The game should've only worried about the versus mode and its mechanics instead of bothering with the mediocre story mode.  What makes it worse is you start with very few characters unlocked in the versus mode so the frustration of story mode is a necessary woe.\n\nA second player or more in story mode and four player support in versus could've really saved the gameplay in this game.  It has a Power Stone-esque feel that screams for multiple players and would've been a great party game.  As it stands its simply mediocre in both single and multi-player modes and not worth more than $20.\n\nGraphic: 4/5\n\nThis is where the game really shines.  The dark and moody graphics really give the characters some attitude.  The characters and backgrounds are both very detailed and the metallic shines of things like Iron Man's armor just looks pretty.  The animations are spot on and give each character a different mood, seeing characters like Spider-Man jump around is particularly fun.  If there's one thing this game does right is you really feel like you are your favorite super heroes although though the game is literally more fun to watch than it is play.  The frantic pace and explosive battles are a beautiful thing to behold.  I would have given graphics a five out of five however EA proves once again that it's not up to the task of actually making a polished game and there are several graphical glitches and other bugs that you will no doubt notice at least once or twice as you play through the game.  It's minor but it's there and it's annoying.\n\nSound: 5/5\n\nSound is there and it does what its supposed to do.  The operatic themes set the dark and epic mood of the clashing titans though you'll rarely ever hear it over the grunting and the explosions.  The sound effects are spot on from character to character and the voice acting is surprisingly well done with no complaints from me except for a few corny lines that are to be expected in a fighting game.\n\nOverall:\n\nI would not recommend this game to a fighting game fan because it's simply too shallow and it's as the fighting game elite calls, \"A button masher.\"  I would however recommend it to comic book fans who want to experience the thrill of battling as their favorite heroes but the game is flawed so don't mortgage your house to purchase Marvel Nemesis.", "Expectations were of a conclusion which did not happen.

Then add in their various mutual friends and others and it was confusing to keep up with until about mid-point when I saw the tie-in between everyone.

Its strange mix of action and roleplaying kept many glued to their chairs for months on end, and spawned nearly as many imitators as the legendary \"Doom.\" In 1997, the formula worked splendidly - but it's the new millennium now that \"Diablo II\" has come to store shelves, and it just feels a little long in the tooth. That hasn't kept it from becoming one of the most overwhelmingly critically praised games of 2000, though. One PC Gamer reviewer went so far as to call it \"the best game ever\" at the time. Apparently he enjoyed the minimal story, the pithy roleplaying elements, and the repetitive click-fest that is \"Diablo II\" - or maybe he just needs to play more games, because this one remains tremendously overrated. I really want to stress how gratingly easy critics were on this game, just because it had the Blizzard logo on the box. Much better games have taken critical beatings, and justice dictates that \"Diablo II\" is put in its proper place. Even so, it's certainly not a bad game, and can become very engrossing despite its lack of depth and dearth of variety.\nThough the \"Diablo\" games can often be found in the roleplaying section, there is little actual roleplaying to be done. You are offered five character options at the beginning of the game, and you pick one of them as your avatar - it's that simple. It should be noted, though, that each character plays quite differently, and all have unique and impressive skills (or spells) that they can employ when things get rough. Of course, you will also tweak your character's stats to your liking as you gain levels, which is why this is considered roleplaying at all.\nIn reality, though, \"Diablo II\" is a top-down isometric action game, and that's just fine. Wading through hordes of demonic baddies is certainly an enjoyable experience - though I myself couldn't help but wish there was more to the game. Combat only ceases when you're in one of the game's three cities (one city per episode), and you really only visit these cities when you need weapons or other items, or perhaps when you're ready to receive your next quest. Quests are extremely linear as well. While playing through the game, I didn't encounter a single quest that was designed to boost experience and was not somehow related to finishing the game's main storyline. I enjoy linearity, personally, but the inability to do your own thing, even just a little bit, keeps \"Diablo II\" from maintaining its freshness. It all boils down to hacking and slashing, leveling up, and repeating that process until the credits roll. It's certainly fun at times, but it's not enough for the game to stay compelling for long periods. Great games transport you to another reality, but \"Diablo II\" will never allow you to forget that you're just staring at your monitor and constantly clicking on things with your mouse. Even the outdoor environments just feel like the spruced up tabletops upon which you are playing with your fantasy-themed action figures.\nOh, yes, and I can't forget to mention that \"Diablo II\" has a truly awful save system that would be more at home in \"Everquest.\" In other words, there's an autosave, and that's about it. It makes casual sittings with the game become more frustrating than they should ever have been, since when you die you'll lose key items in your inventory (like your primary weapons), and you'll have to find your body to recover them. To make matters worse, enemies respawn like rodents when your back is turned, and it's just so bloody  aggravating!\nIn the end, I have been focusing more on the game's faults than its virtues, since I feel that its faults have been least touched upon in the press - but it really is a good game. It is far from achieving the greatness others have claimed, but it's good. If you're one of the few people with a PC and a penchant for gaming on planet earth who hasn't yet picked up a copy, you could be well-served if you're in the mood for some lightweight action. Don't put too much stock in those editorial reviews you've read, though, and take note that games like \"Icewind Dale,\" \"Baldur's Gate,\" \"Divine Divinity,\" and \"Nox\" have all done this isometric roleplaying thing considerably better than \"Diablo II.\" They actually offer depth as well as frenetic combat. (Well, all except \"Nox,\" but it was just so bloody fun!) It's inevitable that Blizzard will eventually begin working on \"Diablo III,\" and though it will certainly make plenty of money for the company, if it's to attain true success it had better acknowledge its peers and offer more than its shallow predecessor.\nFinal Score: C+", "This one took persistence to keep reading but I stuck with  It. If someone told me they had been saved this way, I would have to tell them that Jesus Christ is the Savior and He alone was crucified for my sins along with everyone else in the world. He defeated death and Satan when He arose from the dead. We are saved by grace, not by works. We receive the Holy Spirit after we repent and ask Jesus Christ to be the Lord of our lives. In this book it says very little about Jesus but a lot about the Holy Spirit, even praying to the Holy Spirit, who is always with us, instead of praying to Jesus. I'm sure most who read Christian books know this. Even when the students have their Bible studies, there's no mention of them ever using or even owning a Bible. It never mentioned anyone reading a Bible. I got this book for free but had I bought it, I would want my money back.

The sequel has scarcely changed and this has more disadvantages than advantages. Before explaining about the \"down sides' let's talk about what this game is like. Rollercoaster Tycoon series are about designing your own park, managing it, analysing it, and building the rides and attractions, and creating the ultimate park. Also to that, the developers did lot of field research and added realism to the game as well as adding great physics engine to ride construction, and almost every material in the game really exists. And one of the most remarkable source in the game is the ride construction engine and system. It has the most incredibly simple and extremely free system in construction of rides and gives great depth of creativity, so you can either build a great rollercoaster or a terrible one -All the rides have a excitement, intensity, and nausea value due to it's design- rollercoasters and other track rides can be built by placing track segments.\n\n The park design and management in the game is challenging enough to keep the fun in the game: one ride or one food stall misplaced may cause great loss in profit and park value; price every rides every stalls by analysing the circumstances; angry and dissatisfied guests, or no guests in the park even if you have the perfect rides or value are all the things you'll have to handle in this game. And these things can make you pause the game to analyze the park just to place a burger stall or dealing with the financial board to check your park growth or income from all of the park things.\n\n Although the RCT1 and RCT2 has all these great sources in the game, there are few things that keeps the RCT2 down. First of all, nothing really changed. You select a park and achieve the objective given to you with each scenario and it's almost the same with RCT1, like increasing guests and park value and all those same things. And this game constantly and loads anytime if it has the chance. Which is frustrating because it even loads when exiting to the main menu. To make matters worse, all the scenarios in the game are all unlocked from the start. RCT1 added good old arcade game feature to increase the fun of the game and make the scenarios unlocked if you finish other available parks, so RCT2 loses one of RCT1's advantages. Some people might look forward to the park creator tool, but it's too time consuming and not as easy as it looks. They could have added more improvements in the game like multiplayer mode by the internet for players to challenge their tycoon skills.\n\n Anyway RCT2 era it almost over and the new sequel Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 is being developed with high-quality 3D graphics and diversity in guests with more personality to them. But if it isn't accompanied by a major positive change in the game, it's not going to be a greater game than its earlier versions.\n\n To sum up, Rollercoaster Tycoon series is a great series but the first sequel of the  original Rollercoaster Tycoon needs to be looked carefully before you decide to get it.", "Okay, but too much steam.

Well, after I did the full install, which took up 2.4 gigabyes on my hard drive, my ears were blown off my skull by the sound quality of the opening movie.  It sounded like it was coming out of a home entertainment theater center!\nThe process of character creation was familiar, and a new race, the half-orc, in introduced into the game, along with many extra character classes.  I choose to be a druid because of their ability to shapeshift, and I started out.  There is also a tutorial, but veterans of the first one need not use it, and in a second, you'll find out why.\nIt was soon after I started that I got a sense of extreme deja vu, and worse, ennui.  This game looks EXACTLY the same as the first one, and the interface hasn't changed at all.  You still have to pause the battle ever so often with the space bar, and you still have to run around everywhere looking for stuff and clearing out the map.\nI didn't like all the reading and all the wordy and useless decisions of the first one, and not only did I get a decision-making session as soon as I entered the game, but also, a few minutes into the first level, I was treated with a small library of at least 20 books that, in order to fully understand the game, I must read thoroughly.  That was about the time the ennui set in.  Sure, a little reading is okay, but too much boggles down the game.\nI wouldn't call Baldur's Gate 2 a sequel, because most sequels have different appearances, interfaces, etc.  I would venture to say that this game is more of a mission add-on for the original Baldur's Gate, because while yes, it does have a different story and a few new monsters, the graphics, interface, weapons, and many spells remain essencially the same.  So, I gave it three stars because it's the rating that I gave the original.\nIf Baldur's Gate 3 ever comes out, I have a suggestion...don't be scared to CHANGE something about Baldur's Gate because of what happened when Sierra changed King's Quest 8!", "I didn't receive my product the next day like I was supposed to and I'm a prime member and I paid full price for the product", "Esta es la clsica novelita romntica, entretenida, facil de leer.

Females that aren't either boring sex ciphers, perky and cute anime archetypes, or unrealistic, token \"strong women\" are a rare sight in the video game universe. Young children in active roles are practically non-existent.\n\nIt's encouraging, then, to see Rule of Rose break these two annoying trends. The player takes control of Jennifer, an English schoolgirl who arrives in a bus at a big, spooky house. The premise may seem entirely generic at first, but this is intentional. Absolutely nothing is know of Jennifer's past or even her life at the outset. However, as the game unravels, more and more is revealed until we learn her devastating history.\n\nAs a mystery/horror story, Rule of Rose is a sparkling success. Jennifer runs into and is basically imprisoned by the girls of the Red Crayon Aristocrats. Each girl has a widely different personality, but they are all sadistic yet vulnerable. The Aristocrats function as a sort of female version of Lord of the Flies. Those on top are treated as royalty, while those on the bottom are treated as sub-human filth.\n\nThis game achieves what so little others do: The player strongly feels for Jennifer and is worried for her. While playing, I felt as Jennifer felt, and desperately wanted her to escape.\n\nThe children accentuate this by being perfectly voiced, with not a rotten apple in the bunch. Everyone has genuine English accents, which is vital for believability. No one sounds as if they are simply reading lines, and I never even thought about the voice acting while playing. Which is as it should be.\n\nSlow strings are the musical medium of choice for much of Rule of Rose, and they go well enough with the atmosphere. Slow, tense music plays during suspenseful moments, dramatic songs play during emotional scenes, and faster, intense strings play during battle. Again, it all fits the mood nicely, but there's nothing here that's memorable or of interest outside the game.\n\nClever visual motifs further engross the player into this strange world. Wiggly, child-like animations are used quite a bit, such as in loading screens, chapter introductions, and in books (which serve a similar purpose as memos or notes do in other horror games). These childish doodles often portray brutal content, making them eerie and surreal.\n\nThe in-game graphics are at about the standard for PS2 horror titles. There's nothing here pushing system limits, but nothing noticeably sub-par either. The main cast are understandably much more detailed than other characters.\n\nWith such a nice environment and theme, the developers had a real gem in their hands. It's too bad, then, that they actually make you play the game.\n\nAs Jennifer explores, she will inevitably encounter odd, child-like ghouls. Sadly, she will virtually only encounter these creatures. Lifeless, malicious zombie children? Sure, that's pretty creepy. Unfortunately, the scare factor is completely eliminated when you see them every other step.\n\nJennifer must use whatever she finds lying around to fight her pursuers. Not many guns or swords here. Sure, Jennifer shouldn't be a naturally gifted warrior, but she should cause damage when her entire weapon and arm go through a fiend's body.\n\nEven worse, most foes can harm Jennifer with punches or stabs from several feet away! Or sometimes, even when they're facing the other direction! Horrid hit detection mars Rule of Rose consistently and significantly. This is an unacceptable game design flaw, as it makes combat almost unbearable.\n\nThis nagging problem particularly shows its ugly face during the few boss fights, which should be the peak of enjoyment in most games. The bosses in Rule of Rose are uniformly monotonous, cheap, and tiresome.\n\nMost of these bosses are challenging for all the wrong reasons. They perform the same actions again and again and are entirely predictable. It doesn't matter, though, for along with the monstrous hit detection, Jennifer is as slow as a slug. Both in terms of running speed and arm swing, my 87 year-old grandma is faster.\n\nThese flaws make battles more a game of luck than a test of skill. Did you see that move five seconds in advance? Too bad, you die regardless. Did you work to get behind an enemy to stab him in the back? Oops, missed anyway!\n\nThe exploration elements aren't much better. The game is primarily set in a bizarre, 1930's-style airship, and that's where you'll be exploring most. While this airship is fascinating at first, you will quickly grow tired of it as the game requires you to traverse the same areas over and over. Jennifer's lethargic trot doesn't help matters here, either.\n\nJennifer is accompanied by her dog Brown through most of her journey. While he helps a tiny bit in combat, Brown's main function is to sniff out hidden items. You can let Brown sniff most items in the inventory, and he'll find something related. While this is a novel and interesting aspect, it can get tedious after a while. It does help the player feel affection for Brown, at least.\n\nI often found myself struggling through the game in order to see what happens to Jennifer next. I'm not sure who's crueler: the Aristocrat girls for their evil antics, or the developers for creating such an irresistibly addicting yet agonizingly flawed game.\n\nJudging games like this, ones which have disastrous gameplay yet are good to perfect in every other area, is always difficult. Should you play Rule of Rose? It ultimately comes down to personal taste. If gameplay is categorically the most important part of a game to you, with no exceptions, then absolutely not. If you're willing to ignore severe blemishes to witness a wonderful drama, then yes.\n\nPersonally, I am willing to trudge through the depths to find beauty.", "Did not have to use it yet but it looks like it will do the job", "Smudges easily and collects in corners of eyes throughout the day.

This is Galactic's debut album before they became a household and,during this time they were basically a local New Orleans band. Now not only do I have a lot of books on the subject of funk and friends with whom I share experience with the music but also had the good fortune to have actually seen the music performed live in my own neck of the woods by a band of whom I was acquianted. That particular experience provided me with many of the things that make both great funk and just mediocre funk. The conclusion I have come to is that even with great musicians,great arrangements and great grooves funk doesn't tend to work at it's best without great songs to go with it. At this point Galactic's music is very closely linked to that of...the band that every New Orleans funk band seem to be inspired by: The Meters. And even with them it took them several albums of the same basic type of music to grow as a band. And to be honest Galactic were no different in that respect. This album is loaded with some strong grooves that work with the basic elements of funk from bass/guitar interplay,organs and a great sense of funky drumming. It's all here,but the songs haven't arrived yet. This is a funk jam band here and,honestly the mid 90's weren't exactly lacking in those. Had Galactic chose to stay with this sound from one album to the next they would've sunk into the wordwork very quickly. There is one tune here that does rise above the occasion as a great actual song and features a great lyric sung by the powerful lead singer Theryl DeClouet stating that the conditions of social unrest and injustice that influenced funk's lyric themes during the 70's were still very much there in the 90's and that using funk as a medium to express these concerns musically was still a great way to go. So it's a question of your tastes. If you like actual funk SONGS that happen to have great grooves and messages this album is a little low on that. But if your more into instrumentals that explore funk insturmental vamps than this will probably be right up your alley. It's by no means a terrible album: Galactic are a great band and make excellent funk. But this album doesn't showcase the band as a fully developed musical entity.", "4 minutes into 2nd quarter and Mid-Prairie in the red zone of West Liberty ready to strike again. #iahsfb #kcrgfnl", "#whyimsingle the boys my age haven't matured yet .. ill wait", "I was hoping for a strainer that would work for washing rice.

No new  ground is really being broken here in the way that FreeSpace 2 did, with  its massive capital ship combat and nebula missions.\nThe graphics are  good, and I got great framerates on my Celeron 400 with TNT2 graphics card.  However, there's really heavy distance filtering applied to the textures on  the ships, so if a ship isn't right in your face, it looks like a  brown-grey blob. This is particularly bad because the game relies heavily  on in-engine cutscenes, which come out looking awful this way. You also  can't skip the cutscenes, which is completely annoying.\nThe fighter ship  design is very cool--they all look like vicious WWII fighters--but the  capship design isn't nearly as good, with one or two exceptions. Capship  combat and anti-capship missions are a big letdown when compared to  FS2.\nAs others have stated, the AI is profoundly stupid, and your options  for controlling them are very limited. You're basically alone out  there.\nThe flight model is also weird. You lose turning maneuverability  when you slow down, which is the opposite of most space sims. This makes  the game into a lot of high-speed passing and turning with a great deal of  gunfire, as the ships don't mount many missiles (and the missiles are both  easily evaded and usually ineffective), and there's no standard rearming  in-mission.\nWhat does make the game replayable is cooperative  multiplayer, which you can play on the Zone--you can replay any of the  campaign missions with others.\nDeathmatch multiplayer is a different  story, however. There are a lot of fun variants on deathmatch, but the  actual playing of it is bad. There's a great deal of lag warping and other  weirdness in deathmatch, even if you have a blazing connection to the net.

So deathmatch becomes far less skill than luck, and  not very fun.\nConclusion: you might have some fun with this if you're  bored and looking for a new space action fix, but don't expect it to be the  Next Great Thing, as it's pretty much more of the same. If you've never  played FreeSpace 2, you owe it to yourself to check that out first before  committing to Starlancer.\nOne final note: The force feedback on this game  is absolutely the best I've ever experienced. It almost is reason alone to  try out the game. For the first time, force feedback actually figures  prominently in the gameplay; you hesitate to turn on certain weapons  because your stick will be shaking so hard you won't be able to hit the  target. It definitely adds a lot of fun factor to the flying. I wish other  games' implementations of force feedback were as good.", "This set of ten Stanley screwdrivers, six flat blade, and four Philips, are well made, and very economical.  They are fine for general tasks, but quite frankly the curved handles do not provide the best grip, and they are not an improvement over the proven design previously used by Stanley, and by most other screwdriver manufacturers.\n\nI have used Stanley screwdrivers for many years.  They are economical, and durable, and I was looking to get a new set, but was disappointed to find that the older version I have, with which has grooved straight handles, shaped similar to the Sears Craftsman line, has apparently been discontinued.  I had doubts about the curved handles, but since this set of ten screwdrivers was less than $7, I decided to try them out.  Although these screwdrivers are serviceable, I am not a big fan of the rounded handles, which do not provide a very secure grip.\n\nThe handles have Stanley's familiar black and yellow color scheme, with either a red or blue colored plastic button on the end of the handle.  Red indicates a flat blade, and blue a Philips head.  The set comes with a plastic rack to hold the screwdrivers, but the rack isn't very functional, and seems like an accident waiting to happen.  Stanley used to sell screwdriver sets with decent holder, so this is just another example of the company replacing a very functional design with an inferior one.\n\nBecause this set was so cheap, I did decided to keep it, but these tools would certainly not be my first choice when I need a screwdriver.", "Good well built lens - focus is slow and sharpness suffers at the long end.

The story evolves around a young Englishman in the 1920s, his school friends, their families and some of their adventures growing into adulthood in the post World War I era. The book offers a wonderful sense of time and place although the main character utilizes a strange, detached narrator voice. He's present as events unfold but he's never really a part of what's happening. He just observes, reports and discusses the various people involved.\n\nThe characters in the book are interesting in an English drawing room kind of way, reflecting the strong class struggle that dominated society back then. The novel is well written and offers an excellent portrait of a specific time and place although readers of modern thrillers and suspense novels might find Powell's work a bit slow.", "Rick had a fast growing reputation as a top guitarist of the time, 1974.  The timing of this release was perfect to capitalize on his popularity.  Only problem was even though the timing of the release was perfect the music was not.

Because of the perfect timing and single \"Rock & Roll Hoochie Koo\" the album was a big success. But the overall quality of the album may have hurt his future sales.  The songs all could have used more seasoning but maybe the biggest problem was the production, it is not a very well produced album.

I got frustrated on several levels of the game that required stealth. You don't have any silent weapons that I have seen except the knife and a pistol with a silencer on it. The problem I have run into though is that any little action or movement you do sets off the alarms even if the soldiers don't know you're there so it makes it near impossible to complete these levels. The first time I played the game it took me 20-30 times each to finally finish the stealth oriented levels. It just boils down to poor organization in parts of the game. Overall though it was a great game. It has a great plot and an engrossing storyline. That combined with the great graphics made it an excellent game to play.

I've been itching to read a contemporary romance novel for a while now and this seemed like the right novel but after reading, I generally liked it but didn't love it.\n\nThis story follows Maggie, a 22 year old girl who has just got engaged to her boyfriend of 2 years. However Maggie isn't in a happy relationship and even though she tries, she knows deep down that Jeffery isn't for her. When they go on their engagement trip to British Columbia to a ski lodge, it is there that she meets Taylor; a handsome skier. Maggie and Taylor's attraction is undeniable but with Maggie being engaged to Jeffery, she has to really decide who and what she wants for her future but will Jeffery let Maggie go willingly?\n\nOn the Rim of Love was a loving and likable story. It's was a pretty easy read which was great because this is why I love contemporary romance novels. You can get lost in the story and know there will be a happy ending and the love interest is always to die for.  This is what On the Rim of Love was and I enjoyed it!\n\nThe main character Maggie was really likable and easy to connect with, despite her being quite unsure about her feelings for Jeffery and Taylor, she soon see's who will truly encourage her to follow her dreams but not only that, become the women she has always wanted to become. It was really nice seeing her grow into that person. Now Taylor, I loved him. As soon as he came on the scene you just wanted to get to know him. I really enjoyed all the qualities he brought to the book too. Now the other characters like Jeffery and Bethany.....I really disliked. They were all shallow, selfish and were money hungry and from page one I hated them. None of them redeemed themselves either so I still dislike them now. So, overall Maggie and Taylor made this book for me.\n\nThe story itself was likable; I have to admit I got kind of bored with the ski references so when Maggie bought in her Photography dreams, it was a welcome addition to the book. I also didn't really think the end of the story with the light and dreams were necessary. I would have preferred that part cut out of the story but is what is it but still enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nIf you're looking for a light and quick read that will leave you satisfied, then this is the novel for you.

First, the arcade style seems a bit outdated and due to the camera angle, which primarily has you looking down on the characters, makes you feel almost detached from the game.  It doesn't help that your character often blends in with the bad guys, especially in the darker levels.  This isn't as noticeable when you are playing as Superman or Flash with the bright red costume but it is a bit of an issue when playing as some of the other characters.  At times, when you are fighting next to large objects, the characters are completely obscurred.\n\nAnother complaint is the inability to select which characters you will use to complete a mission, especially early on in the game as they are pre-selected.  The graphics are decent although the backgrounds tend to be a bit generic and you'll see the same thing over and over.  There are essentially no areas to explore outside of the general gameplay area and in fact, you can't access many of the areas due to police roadblocks, etc.  This seems almost ridiculous since your character can pick up cars and throw them but you can't move a wooden road block.  The voice work is good but you'll hear the same comments repeatedly.  The interaction between the characters is also odd.  Batman seems to almost detest Superman: \"I didn't ask for your help\" kind of thing.  Superman is a bit smug as well.  Ah, super egos.\n\nThe game is a button masher for sure and there is very little challenge to figuring out what you need to do to progress.  The controls are very easy to learn and combos are typically limited to 4 buttons.  There is a great deal of repetition in the enemies you'll fight as well.  The first few levels consist of robots, robots and more robots, followed by robots and giant bees...yes, bees.  Checkpoints are frequent and you can use them to revive a fallen team mate.  The levels are short and the game itself is short.  If compared to other superhero games, \"Justice League Heroes\" is better than most but if you compare to other fighting games, it falls short.

THE RIGHT TRIGGER TO PASS. So why did I buy EA Sports' product over the smoother, pass and teamwork-friendly NHL 2K7, with its numerous game modes, ground-breaking camera angle and excellent online playability?\n\nIt is as the rumors say: The Skill Stick.\n\nEvery gaming review has advised that it may take up to over a dozen games just to get used to the NHL 07 Skill Stick, which, undisputedly, is the future of video game hockey. Say to yourself, \"Learn it now, and hope NHL 08 will have the rest of its game presentation catch up to its technology.\" But the reviews are spot on--you will need at least a dozen games to get comfortable.\n\nThere are several tweaks and things you can do to ease yourself in: set your controller settings to \"Classic\" and change \"Camera Relative\" to \"Always Up\" to be able to have a hybrid controller where you can use the classic EA Sports hockey setup, as well as the Skill Stick; play hours of the Shootout mode; and start off playing at the Pro level for about three games, before moving on to more difficult play.\n\nLet me put it this way: you intercept a pass in the neutral zone, and skate untouched toward the opposing goalie. God help you if your only option is to press a deke button, aim, and shoot, and hope the computer odds let your goal in.\n\nNow imagine being able to skate up, deke left, pull right for a wrister, then, just as the goalie commits to the right side, pull your stick back left and flip it top shelf, backhanded over his glove.\n\nImagine no more. If you can think it, the Skill Stick can do it: high, low, five-hole, top shelf, flip, wrister, slap, snap...everything. It just  seems ridiculous that you would want to skate in such critical moments such as breakaways, penalty shots and shootouts without at least an 85 percent chance of scoring. Sure it's offensively biased, but in real-life hockey, the one-on-one situation will always favor the skilled scorer against the skilled goalie--the scorer just has too many moves, and the goalie can only react.\n\nIt'll be a sacrifice, so buying the game used is probably recommended; it's not a complete package, but you'll be glad you've mastered the Skill Stick by the time a hopefully superior NHL 08 comes out, with you steps ahead of the rest of the competition.\n\nIf you like team play, with great passing, and bum rush the net strategies, get the 2K7 offering. It's user-friendly, and you can be reasonably competitive online in a matter of two or three games. But if the thrill of getting to an open spot on the ice and having every shot aimed at ANY location at your disposal, 07's Skill Stick is by far the way to go. It's like comparing Doom II to 360's Ghost Recon, in terms of controls.\n\nIt may not be this year, but the Skill Stick era is about to dominate the video game hockey landscape.", "This card well with PlayStation 2 games but will not save PlayStation 1 games.

The switch worked to some degree with the dimmable LED bulb -- the only issue is that  it doesn't always come on when the dimmer is set for the lowest brightness level -- that's because the bulb must draw a certain amount of power in order for the SCR circuit in the switch to turn on.

Especially when they capture beautiful pictures that just makes us want to stare at it all day.\n\nFlash gave me that. And I'm glad that I got to know what Kip Chanin was thinking all throughout the book.\n\nI admire the strength of the lead character, Kip. She was used to taking care of herself ever since, because her mother wasn't exactly the best mom that one can have. She's lying to people about her age, when in fact she was not really 18.\n\nAnd here comes Alex, the actor who helped Kip have a job by just taking a photo of him. I was surprised when Alex contacted Kip and told her he wanted his pictures taken. And I loved the way Kip photographed Alex. That scene, where Kip acted that she was late and kept Alex waiting really got him over the edge and guess what? In that moment, he showed her the real Alex and that was what Kip wanted to capture and not the boy-next-door image that everybody else always sees.\n\nThere were times when I really believed that Kip was older because she is so mature and she knows what she wants. She has determination and she is independent.\n\nI was just quite confused with the mystery involved in this story, about Alex's family. And also, I think that the relationship of Alex and Kip was underdeveloped. They only knew each other for a short amount of time and they didn't have many 'moments' in the book, that's why I was not really into the romance part of it. There were also times where the author will surprise us because both characters have such strong personalities and they clash, but in the end, they always seem to complement each other even if they both have flaws.\n\nOne character that I also loved was Bay, because she was like the mother of Kip in this story. Yes, she is tough, but the author slowly unraveled her and in some way, she has still has this golden heart which makes her more passionate and caring.\n\nAnother thing that I loved was the setting. It was in L.A. And we all believe that L.A. is a city where our dreams can come true, but I admired Kip for getting to see the downside in living there.\n\nThe ending also got me thinking about what will happen next and I really want to know what Kip and Alex will do to save the relationship that they have.", "GamesBeat University showcases the best tips and secret tricks of successful games http://t.co/yT1qY08nDk", "I didn't find that it really helped much with the fleas,otherwise it was okay.

So of course I had too purchase coffee!!! So I bought like six pounds of this stuff. The Machine came a couple of days before my coffee so I ran to the store and purchased Pete's French roast whole beans. I would have purchased Italian roast but there was not any in whole bean.\n\nWith the Pavoni there is a learning curve because you have to get the right grind and Pull your own shot..... Blah, Blah, Blah. Well I eventually got it right. I remember my first Capuchino in Italy...Maybe you have been there before???? It tasted like they put chocolate in it???? Of course it did not have chocolate in it but it tasted almost like Hot Cocoa at least to me. In retro spect to my home brew I went thru half a bag of beans to get it right but I did and it was the first time in the States I ever tasted Capuchino that had that chocolate type flavor.\n\nNow today I received a box of this stuff(three huge bags) so my journey begins.... This coffee is a medium roast(brown in color) and the Beans look very fresh... Also what the name implies is that you will get Crema. That is completely true. You will get a Crema even if you do not know what you are doing. Why is that???? Well probably because the roast is lighter and not very oily???\n\nAs far as flavor goes? Everyone has their own taste.. I like certain things like hot spicy food etc. some people do not, so I hate to judge flavor according to my taste Buds. So what am I trying to say???? Obviously I do not like it but that does not mean that you won't. The quality of the Beans look great but I feel that the taste is Bitter and not because I over heated my Machine. I still have a very undesirable taste in my Mouth.\n\nBottom Line.... If you want that Chocolate type Flavor??? I doubt that you will ever get it from this Roast.... Yes you will get Crema and I am not pushing the other brand that I mentioned but I think you have to go with a Fresh Dark Roast... Even when I was playing with my new toy and did not get a good crema the coffee still had that great flavor.... So as far as I am concerned...

The computer not only meets the system requirements but also meets the recommended standards, so there shouldn't have been a problem.  However, the review materials suggest that it was designed around Vista instead of XP, and that may explain its slowness.\n\nThis software has also proved to be a remarkable memory hog.  I'm used to multitasking and switching between programs, and I just can't do that when using this product.  It doesn't even swap well between its own features.\n\nBut that's enough complaining about the slowness - - how well does it let you manipulate sounds, pictures, and so on?  To test this, I set myself two simple tasks: to set a slideshow to music, and to create a panorama out of several photos.  The slideshow task was simple and menu-driven, and easy to do.  The software imported the pictures and the music very slowly, and the project was slow to save, but it looked very nice when all done.  However, I could have done the same thing in PowerPoint.\n\nThe second task also worked well, and was much more impressive.  I had four pictures of a dune that I wanted to piece together.  I had not originally taken them as a panorama, so the pictures had somewhat different focal lengths and exposures.  Some overlapped a little, others a lot.  The software has an automatic panorama tool that fit three of the four pictures together well.  It was a little off on the last seam, but a \"fine tune\" tool allowed me to get it closer manually, and then the software finished the seam off.  Some seams were easy, requiring only that the software identify \"dune,\" \"water,\" and \"sky.\"  However, I was particularly impressed by the more difficult seams, which required getting brown grass stitched together right, as well as an area of leafy shrubs.  Very impressive.\n\nThe software also uses irregular stitches, so that there isn't a hard line between pictures.  One of those seams more or less disappeared, and the others look OK, given the poor raw material that I gave the program.\n\nYet again, simple tasks were slow.  It took me five minutes to save the panorama and then open it in the photo editor.  The photo editor was also very intuitive and easy to use, and I was able to fiddle with the brightness and contrast of the resulting panorama.  Those tasks, too, were slow to load, but sped up with use (presumably because of caching).  Save times got down to 30-35 seconds, which is OK but slower than other software I've used.\n\nAll in all: I'm impressed by what it can do, and how well it can do it, but it's frustratingly slow.

In addition, they are made cheaper than the original controllers and are not as durable, so they will not last as long. My recommendation is to not buy these controllers and get refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers on (...) or the exact replica version because they use the same exact materials to make those controllers as Nintendo does for their controllers.

FB is a PAINTERS PAINTER, that is his works to the best educated and successful professional artists, know that Branwyn's works are a pleasure to study and an inspiration to their own careers.

I am therefore downgrading the product to 1* as it has extremely OBNOXIOUS requirements to use.\n\nSTOP THIS STOP THIS STOP THIS.\n\nThis camera is a cute jewel!  It does a really nice job (when paired with the FLIR One App on iOS or Android) of combining the 640x480 visual color camera with the 160x120 IR camera into one image. You also have a lot of flexibility of how this is done and furthermore the information is kept separate so that the program FLIR Tools for iOS or Mac can then analyze and visualize and many different forms.  Overall I am quite impressed on how good the software is in taking the visual and IR images together and making it a \"compelling story\".\n\nThe only annoyance is that the camera cannot be used if the iphone is in any kind of a case.  The case needs to be removed or one needs to use an extension adapter or cable (have not tried yet but should work).  UPDATE: it works with a lighting extension cable quite well.\n\nAnother problem is that there isn't a lot of proper documentation on how to use these tools and the company website does not have any useful documentation either (though they are VERY nice responding questions).  When using the FLIR One iOS camera here is how to actually use the MacOS app (Flir Tools).  I presume that for PCs it would be similar.\n\n1) Connect iphone to computer, open itunes and go to apps.  Go to the FLIR One app and download THE ENTIRE FOLDER Images.\n2) Now you can import the FOLDER into this application.  And voila!  All the goodies work!\n\nIf you actually use icloud to download the photos (or any other means not described above) to your computer then all extra information is gone and the analysis applications do not work.\n\nSo you need to do the extra step.  It would be useful if one could somehow do things in a more practical way but I am now reasonably satisfied.\n\nTo FLIR:  please put better documentation up.  This will save you some tech calls/emails and reduce user frustration.

Lewis presents a disappointing defense of Christianity and Christian Ethics.  The primary advantage of this work is that it is clearly written, and uses many analogies to help illustrate its points to the reader.  The major disadvantage, however, is that these analogies and analysis are far too simplistic.  By introducing an analogy Lewis merely assumes it as proof of the very thing he is trying to argue.  Page after page is filled with analogy and reasoning which seems to rest on an undefended assumption.  His argument that Christ was either \"Divine or a Madman\" for calling himself the Son of God, and that therefore we must believe the former is really ludicrous.  Any number of persons have been false prophets and made false claims, but because the claims are outrageous doesn't mean we must accept them.  If Christ is any different, he has not shown how Christ's ideas were different, which is where he should have gone.  I write this from the perspective of one friendly to the Christian religion and its ethics, and simply don't think Lewis has done a very good job in arguing for the Christian religion.

As you can imagine that makes life extremely difficult for her and her family are all worried about how hard it is for her to feed. Her mother decides to take matters into her own hands and she kidnaps a psychologist who specialises in phobias so that he can help Lissianna get over her fears. Things start to go wrong when Lissianna wrongly assumes that Greg is her dinner rather than her doctor but surely one quick bite isn't going to do any harm?\n\nI've been wanting to try the Argeneau series for such a long time now so when I was offered a review copy of A Quick Bite I was really excited and couldn't wait to get started. I'm a huge paranormal romance fan, it's one of my go to genres and I'll never get tired of reading about vampires and other creatures that go bump in the night. I picked this up expecting a fairly light and funny read along the lines of Katie MacAlister's Dark Ones series and I have to say for the first couple of chapters I thought that was exactly what I had got but unfortunately the humour got old very fast and I ended up hating most of the characters.\n\nLissianna is a 200 year old vampire but along with her cousins (some of whom are even older than she is!) she acts like a 12 year old tween most of the time. They were all just so incredibly childish that it was hard to take any of them seriously and I ended up getting really annoyed with all of them. The way they all kept spying on Lissianna and Greg was just creepy and so was the way everyone could read his mind and know that he was constantly thinking how hot she was. I just got very tired of all the erection jokes! On the subject of Greg I thought is reactions to the situation he found himself in were completely unbelievable. He wakes up in a strange house tied to the bed after arriving in very unusual circumstances yet he's more interested in the thought of being the beautiful stranger's willing sex slave than he is about trying to escape. We get told a lot about how attracted they are to each other but if I'm honest I just didn't feel the chemistry between them, it all felt very clinical and there wasn't enough of a build up for me to feel invested in their relationship.\n\nAlthough this story is mainly focused on the romance there was also a bit of a suspense plot in the background with someone attempting to murder Lissianna. That could have added something to the book and made it much more interesting apart from the fact that a five year old would have been able to tell you who was behind the attempt pretty much the first time we met their character. It was so completely obvious that the perpetrator might as well have been walking around with \"I'm a Vampire Hunter\" tattooed across their forehead yet Lissianna didn't once think to question their weird behaviour. To put it politely Lissianna is an idiot, I think this quote says it all:\n\nLissianna shook her head, thinking it was rather amazing she'd survived to reach two hundred if she'd made many mistakes like that over the years.\n\nHonestly I'm not sure how she made it to 200 either, she made so many stupid mistakes when it came to feeding that I stopped counting them but I feel like I spent half the book rolling my eyes at her.\n\nI'm just so disappointed that this book didn't work for me because I had such high hopes for it in the beginning. I am kind of tempted to give the next book a try though, first books in a series can always be a bit hit and miss and since this series is still going strong after 24 books have been published there must be something good about it. So I may give it a second chance at some point but unfortunately I don't think I'll be in any rush, not when there are so many other books on my TBR pile that I'm actually excited about reading.\n\nSource: Received from Gollancz in exchange for an honest review", "My dog, who is normally very gentle with all her toys, managed to remove one of the monkey's arms within 15 minutes.

Hillary is their perfect candidate! https://t.co/rP2z1upkwM", "I hemmed and hawed about buying a pair of self-powered monitors versus a Dayton T-amp with a pair of Dayton bookshelf speakers (both very well reviewed on various audiophile discussion boards), which would have come in at just around a hundred bucks, but finally decided against it due to the sheer size of the speakers, plus the additional tangle of cords/cables that would entail.  Then I started to read up on the M-Audio AV30s and AV40s, but kept hearing persistent complaints about poor reliability...so when I finally stumbled upon these, I was totally stoked by the price and the form factor---these are somewhere in the middle in terms of size between 6.5\" bookshelf speakers like the Daytons, and your typically tiny and tinny-sounding 2\" computer speakers.\n\nThese M1s have 3\" woofers, so of course you're not going to get thumping bass---since I despise techno and most forms of rap/house anyway (mostly listen to jazz, classical, and vocal/guitar-dominated rock and folk), this was not an issue.  Though I have to agree with the other reviewers that what bass they do put out is quick, tight and accurate.\n\nBut the real magic is in the tweeters: they are full 1\" silk domes, which is exactly what you want for stunning detail and clarity and imaging.  I have no idea why the Amazon listing for this product neglects to mention this outstanding fact.  Even the Dayton full-size bookshelf speaker has only a 3/4\" tweeter, and what few 2.0 computer speakers that have tweeters, usually have only 1/2 to 3/4\" tweeters---this often produces a smeared and veiled quality to the upper mids and highs.  You usually have to pay $300 and up to get a 1\" tweeter in a pair of decent bookshelf speakers.  Just like the run of the mill Logitechs and Altec Lansings, Bose's computer speakers have 2\" single drivers as do their home theater \"jewel cubes\"---hence the common ditty, \"No highs, no lows, it must be Bose.\"\n\nThe Alesis tweeter is also remarkable for its non-fatiguing smoothness...I can listen to these speakers for hours and hours without the notorious \"listener fatigue\" that results from overly bright tweeters and their over-the-top treble.\n\nThere is a bass boost switch you can turn on, but like all \"bass boost\" settings, this simply exaggerates the mid-bass and creates a very unnatural sound---which, sadly enough, is what too many consumers are used to these days.  So if you like a smiley-shaped EQ curve (bass and treble maxed out), these are probably not the speakers for you...get a Klipsch or Logitech or Altec Lansing 2.1 system instead.\n\nThe other standout feature on these speakers that sealed the deal for me was the USB connection. Most computer speakers connect with the 1/8\" headphone jack...which means that they are using your computer's built-in soundcard, which usually are mediocre at best, and on many lower-end laptops can be absolutely horrible (hissy and shrill).  With a USB connection, you are sidestepping the internal sound card and having the speakers' convert the signal directly, which yields by far the purest, noise-free sound output possible.  Standalone USB DACs (Digital Audio Converters) which do the same thing can go anywhere from $30 for the cheapest to several hundred bucks...so to have this already included in the system is really a HUGE treat!\n\nNow, to put this into perspective: these are NOT party speakers!  If you are dumb enough to try to use them in that capacity, you deserve to be bummed out.  They are also not home theater speakers, so while their voice reproduction is top-notch, you are not going to get deep rumbles and wall-shaking explosions (you really need a sub for that, in any case).  They are designed for nearfield listening at low to moderate volumes (about 70db tops).  They are not quite audiophile grade, but definitely mid-fi, which means several notches above the typical $50-200 computer speakers you are going to find at Best Buy if a balanced, accurate sound is what you are looking for...for eighty three bucks they are an absolute STEAL!\n\nUPDATE 10/19/12: I received the first Alesis speakers on October 9th, at which point I wrote the above review...LOVED them.  Less than a week later, the right speaker suddenly died for no apparent reason...I was using it only lightly, and with the volume only at the 9 to 10 o'clock position.  So, I figured this was just the luck of a draw, everyone gets a lemon once in a while.  So I shipped it back to Amazon, they had a new on my doorstep by 10/18...and guess what?  This time, the right speaker was DEAD ON ARRIVAL!!!  ARRRRRRRGH!!!  I am wondering if I should go through the process one more time, or try something else.  Really really annoying because I otherwise love the sound quality!  Nothing else in this ballpark comes even close...but why oh why was the QA on this product so horrible???\n\n0 for 2...I'm sorry Alesis, I'm looking elsewhere now.\n\nDowngraded rating from 5 to 2 stars.", "After installing and trying out this product for nearly a month, I'd have to say stick with Quickbooks.

There are a few new features (actually more for me since I haven't updated in a while) like stop motion animation capabilities and motion tracking.\n\nHowever, this one seems more buggy than I remember the last version to be when I installed it. First, I had to completely uninstall 17 (I thought I could just update but you have to start fresh) before installing this. Its a large program and took a LONG time to install. Especially since I had to retry a few times due to error messages that even now are inexplicable to me. Anyway, I finally installed it in full with all the extra stuff. I installed this on a Sony Vaio with a fast processor so there shouldnt have been so many problems.\n\nThe program itself is VERY slow and there are so many issues with syncing, playing a video either didn't play at all or was delayed and there is no preview. For the life of me I cant get that preview window to function. Maybe there was a problem with the installation so I am (gasp) going to uninstall it and then reinstall it to see if that will fix it.\n\nAt that point, if I cant get this up and running, Ill just reinstall 17.

Amazon should not even sell this game anymore and offer a partial refund to all that have been duped into buying it on here.", "The game reproduces the world of the Simpsons faithful down to the humor and the voices. Unfortunately, as a video game it's more a test of memory than a game of challenge and skill. The more times you go through the maze the quicker you get. You can drive mostly any vehicle that comes along but it's best to stick with the assorted lots offered in the menu. I wanted badly to like this game since I love the Simpsons and got this game for the kids. They stopped playing it after running into so many false level-endings. That's where I took over fresh from playing \"Need for Speed: Underground\". You become various characters driving around Springfield to find clues to a mystery regarding black vans and crop circles. The automatic camera controls are by far the worst. It jumps erratically from chase view to overhead view if you get stuck in a tight corner or running on foot. This greatly interferes with game play. The physic's gravity is terrible. I had my car hanging on the pier edge forever unable to decide whether to fall or not. The graphics is 3-D cartoon. At times, I find myself manually circling the camera several times to see where items are positioned and where the ledges are \"really\" located to jump on. The vehicle jump cam is also a big problem. It's set to \"On\" by default but can be turned \"Off\" in Options. It's no good if I can't see where you're going to land after doing a ramp jump. The task themselves are simple but after getting to a certain location or collecting such and such an items under a time limit, the player is then immediately tasked to go to another location before time runs out to start yet another part of the level.  There can be 2-4 parts to these levels and failure at anytime along the way results in the player starting the level all over. There is no way for anybody other than the programmers themselves to get through all the levels the first time. The game is unforgiving making a wrong turn or get stuck by a car will mean doing the level over. There's no room for error. When tasked to go to a location, you have to rely heavily on the overlay map and green arrows on the road to know where to go while dodging pedestrians and vehicles that to me seem to have a death wish to jump into the path of your vehicle. Hitting the items gains you coins. Another problem is that some items you can crash through and some items are solid like the Rock of Gibraltar. There's no way to tell the difference without trial and error. If too many items are hit in a certain amount of time then the police comes in hot pursuit of you. If you're caught; you pay a 50 coin fine. Finally, the game cheats the player by running over your character trying to get to your vehicle, placing your vehicle way down the street or  stopping the game with time still left on the clock. I'm sure that the creators licensed the game to the video game developers and may have even wrote a basic story plot but as the video game part it's totally weak. By changing the XBOX's clock to holiday dates like Christmas, Springfield will change it's appearance to match the holiday moods.

When I went to use it yesterday on our Town and Country it did the same thing as the first one and the trigger stuck in the on position.  I realize these are not supposed to be used over 100 psi, this should not have mattered though as I only turned the regulator up to 90 psi to fill the truck to 80 psi, and was only using 75 psi at the regulator.

These are great things to have in an air hose. The fact that its hard to kink is somewhat irrelevant because under pressure, I've never experienced a kink in my regular rubber air hose.\n\nThis hose just continues to annoy me though. The big problem is that it won't lay flat on the floor. It will lay twisted and semi-coiled no matter how many times you unwind or untangle it during use. The coils on the floor create 6 to 8 inch \"bridges\" of hose that you will inevitably trip over, become tangled in, and then curse like a sailor. I cant count how many times the hose has literally wrapped around my foot by accident. I'd bet that 25% of those instances caused me to mis-step or flat out trip and stumble. My good old rubber hose lays flat on the floor and has never caused me an ounce of disgust.

This incarnation of the game looked and sounded fun so I bought it based on the raves I heard....  The graphics are fun, its nice to have everything in 3D but that is about the only upside to this game.\nThe things that I was looking forward to the most, new trade and diplomacy options, are a bust.  Trade is easier now but you just really cannot get anything useful out of it.  Trade does not function well.  You have to have a sea route or a land route to an AI country to trade with it.  Once there is a sea route you and the AI need harbors.  But the AI's don't build harbors for centuries, even when they can.  For a land route, you have to build a road. You can expect that the closest AI will also always be your enemy so good luck trading with them or though them (you can but you lose the route when you go to war with your neighbor. All the AI's almost always demand more than the trade is worth.  Then they are very happy to drop trading with you and trade amongst themselves, cutting the human player out totally.\nTrade and diplomacy are inextricably linked now.  This gets to the biggest disappointment - diplomacy worked much better in Civ 2.  Diplomacy is a misnomer in this game.  AI's demand, you basically have to give in.  You ask and MAYBE can get what you want by giving up everything you have, only to have the AI become annoyed or furious with you anyway.  This is not because I do not know how to negotiate - I do it for a living, you just cannot get anything but a bad deal in this game.\nSo that leaves just waging war mostly. Here, the game has picked up one of the more unfortunatel traits of Civ 2.  The AI's do not have to build any city improvements BUT YOU DO TO KEEP YOUR PEOPLE HAPPY.  The upshot is that they have the time and the money to spend building armies that you MUST devote to building other things.  A few good tactical victories during the inevitable war usually gets the AI to the peace table but you have to start rebuilding everything destroyed from scratch wasting more time and money. The AI just goes back to building Wonders and military units and then blitzes you with dozens of units the next time around.  It becomes dull and repetitous.\nI would have been happier if they had just taken Civ 2 and improved the graphics -  that would have been enough.  Instead they ruined the game.

Worse, the signal comes in and out when it says \"connected\" on my computer.\n\nBeen talking to tech support and customer service for the last 2 months. Finally, tech support told me that they'd replace my router for me at no cost to me, and would even have someone pick up my old, defective router so that I do not have to pay for the shipping of the old router back to them. In order to do so, I had to call customer service for arrangements. To my surprise (and my waste of time) customer service coldly said that it's company policy that I pay the shipping for the routers.\n\nI agreed to settle the issue through replacement because I don't have to pay for the shipping and that since I will supposedly receive the new router first, I will not have any down time not having a connection at home. This was agreed upon with tech support, and customer service decides to change that? Isn't there some sort of credibility with company promises and first-decisions?\n\nI know it's their company policy that I pay shipping to send my defective router back to them, but since their techician told me otherwise, should they not also honor the exception?\n\nSigh, I don't think I can take this any more.

It was so compact and easy to move around, which is a relief when you live in a small home filled to the brim with kids toys! As opposed to most large easels that require large amounts of floor space even when not in use, I really loved that this one could be folded up into a small size and stored away in an instant. However... within 3 months of receiving it, this product was literally falling apart at the seams. Now normally when a baby toy falls apart after a few months of use, I think \"well, yes, that's why I buy inexpensive toys - kids break them, duh!\" - except, my son was only 9 months old when this broke beyond repair, and had never physically manipulated this product at all! The only us this easel had gotten was from me taking it out about once a week and showing him some magnets while he gazed at it with interest before we fairly quickly moved on to the next activity, at which point I'd fold it up as directed and put it away until next week. Yet every time I folded up and unfolded this easel I noticed the seams were becoming flimsier and flimsier, the boards were seemingly tearing apart... but I still never expected to open it up one afternoon just to see one board finally break free and fall to the ground! All of this from an adult gently using this product for a few minutes, once a week? Yeah, in that case it was pretty disappointing!\n\nI must add that I love leaving reviews here as reading others' reviews helps me so much and I try to give back the same way. And maybe I'm just a really positive person in general, or perhaps I've just had good luck, but the fact remains that I virtually NEVER leave negative reviews for products, ever. I've written hundreds  of reviews here on Amazon and am quite sure this is only the 5th product, if that, that I've given less than 3 stars. I still can't bring myself to give it only 1 star as it WASN'T expensive, so I don't expect that much by way of quality and am not  exactly HORRIFIED that it fell apart, but I am certainly surprised that a few months of occasionally opening up, briefly using, and then properly storing away this little easel was enough to just... destroy it. Bizarre! And since I only owned one of these, I didn't try buying a second, I can't say with certainty that mine wasn't a rare defective one as there are certainly plenty of positive reviews on here... but I still wanted to share my experience because I know that many times people leave reviews after just receiving a product, or certainly within a few weeks of using it, and may not update those reviews later on. So perhaps if more reviews were left after several months of owning and using the product, there would be more experiences like mine... all I know for sure is that I try to be very reasonable with my expectations, and nothing short of a piece completely falling apart after gentle use would cause me to leave a negative review, so to anyone who's looking for an easel that will last them a long time, this may not be the one for you! However, if you just need this for a short period of time and don't want to shell out a fortune for it than this might meed your needs just fine.

It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.\n\nAdditionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.\n\nFor the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS.

Starting in 2007 they introduced that horrid Ribbon interface which completely replaced the traditional and intuitive drop-down menus with a confusing jumble of icons spread amongst different tabs. Almost immediately the user base was divided between people who like the ribbon, and people like myself who can't stand it. In the years since I've been forced to use Office 2007 and 2010 at work, I've gotten used to the ribbon to some extent but I still hate it. In addition to that, newer versions of Office introduced a new .docx file format which Office 2003 does not support. This change strikes me as a blatant attempt to force users to upgrade in order to share documents with users of Office 2010.\n\nOffice was a victim of its own success. Office 2003 is superb, it does everything I need it to do and more, and it does it well.

Yet the whole is less than the sum of its parts. It aspires to European complexity while paradoxically wallowing in American sensationalism.  It tries to paint a subtle moral landscape with a gallon of latex semi-gloss and a roller, with lurid supporting characters that could have come from Ricki Lake's green room.\nBy now everyone knows that the story centers on Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), whose life has become an empty, materialistic nightmare with his disrespectful daughter and frigid wife (Annette Benning).  He changes things - a bit too drastically - and ends up becoming a blackmailer, a drug user, and a would-be pedophile.  That he changes his mind at the last minute and doesn't have sex with the teenaged girl, that he ends up martyred because the next-door neighbor thinks (through a bizarre misunderstanding) that he's been taking sexual advantage of his son, that he has some New-Aged revelation about the Circle of Life as he's dying...well, all that's supposed to make him OK.\nIf American Beauty had committed to making Lester either a villain or a hero, it might have worked better.  Instead, it asks us to see him as a flawed, complex man - and forgive him.  That might been possible, had this loopy, creaky, arbitrary series of plot devices not been employed in place of a real story.\nFor every theme explored in American Beauty, better films exist.  Either film version of Lolita, for example, develops the theme of middle-aged crisis coupled with pedophilia far more logically and empathetically, and without resorting to an unconvincing, last minute change of heart to \"redeem\" the main character.", "Not overly impressed", "@AmericanAir I need to order a special meal and I can't reach AA.

I think that this is because the instructions tell you to back out the screws and then snug after putting the one piece in. I didn't find that backing out the screws was necessary at all. And frankly, if I did do that, it would have been a problem, which is one of the flaws of this vacuum.\n\nThe vacuum where it transitions from the wand to the hose, in one cleaning of my wood stove insert, clogged there twice. I had to remove the hose from the base unit, remove the tools and empty the clogs out.\n\nOne other major shortcoming is the hose length. At three feet, I have to hold the vacuum in one hand and move the hose around with the other. It's a proprietary hose unlock many shop vacs so you cannot buy something aftermarket. Perhaps they sell a longer hose.\n\nWith the negatives out of the way, I will say it's such an environmental improvement vacuuming the ash out instead of the shovel/bucket method which fills the air with dust. This combined with now burning eco-bricks, I've made a significant reduction in household dust.\n\nThe label of ash vac is somewhat misleading as applied to this unit. It's more of a shop-vac with a fine particulate hepa style filter. Instructions say to use on cool ashes, they don't mention the 122 degrees as listed here on the site. Other ash vacuums are rated over 1,000 degrees. Those vacuums are double the price, but if you start a fire once and burn all season...\n\n<update> I moved this down to one star. This isn't worth much. I've now found that for a normal ash load in my stove, I need to take the thing apart, three to four times to unclog the hose. Where the hose goes into the collection chamber, it makes a 45 degree bend, this clogs readily, then backs the hose up.\n\nThe head where you put the attachments, is stripped out and no longer latches.\n\nOnly nice thing is that it isn't as loud as a typical shop vac.", "Did not like the taste of these.

If you really want to watch the films in chronological order, you need to start with \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" (occurs in 1935) then watch \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (occurs in 1936).\n\nWhen \"Temple\" opens, Indy's (Ford) trying to get an idol from Chinese gangsters. He manages to escape them--but unwittingly ends up on one of their planes with nightclub singer Willy (Capshaw) and 12-year-old Chinese orphan boy Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan).\n\nIndy wakens to discover their pilot has bailed out and left them without parachutes.  They crashland and end up in India.  A beleaguered village elder seeks Indy's help to recover their sacred stones and the kidnapped village children.  What they discover is a Thugge cult.\n\nThis is probably the roughest of the Jones flicks so far and IMHO, stretches the PG-13 rating to the breaking point with violence, harm to children. Capshaw is supposed to be a comedic foil, but she just comes off useless. Short Round is cute, but he's not Sallah and Spielberg must have realized that, because he doesn't appear in later films. Harrison Ford is good--he just can't quite carry the whole film on his rugged shoulders.\n\nRebecca Kyle, May 2008", "As mentioned in other reviews, there is an issue with how the toy's eyes are painted.

It has become so bad that water wets my socks from a walk through a field with morning dew. When I received these, I noticed that there was only a small amount of glue that appeared to hold the rubber outsole to the upper at the toes and it looked pretty precarious. But, I figured that these were Merrell's and they would hold up. I expect more from Merrell and I expect more from an $80 shoe. They are still comfortable, but I am now pretty much restricted to using them indoors only. Based on the other reviews being overwhelmingly positive, I think this defect may be limited to the camo version.\n\nOtherwise, this is a nice shoe:\n\nUnlike neoprene versions (e.g., Bogs), these slippers are extremely breathable. They keep your feet comfortably warm in the cold (even in single digits), but they don't sweat. To me, there is no worse feeling than your feet shedding sweat nonstop because they can't breathe in your shoes. I will gladly trade the lack of complete waterproof-ness for breatheability. This breatheability also means that these are fine to wear in the summer, whereas those made from neoprene will be unbearably hot.\n\nThese come in half-sizes. Many similar outdoor slippers do not, which can be a big deal if you wear a half-size. I am an 11.5, not a 12. I walk out of 12s and 11s scrunch my toes. Merrell is smart enough to realize that skipping out on half-sizes will make many people unable to wear these.\n\nThese slippers are extremely comfortable and easy to slip in and out of. You can feel the cushioning as you walk -- it is firm, but cushioned -- exactly what I want in an outdoor slipper. They provide great traction and grip on all outdoor surfaces, including snow- and ice-covered surfaces.", "The shoelaces are not too hard to install and they are good looking.

And this is a darn abominable shame, because the game itself is actually a lot of fun.\n\nFirst of all, the game loves to crash on me when I least expect it.  When I visit Beast/Forge's shop and choose the \"see equipment\" option, the game will sometimes kick me out to the title screen!  And if I haven't saved my game in the last 5 seconds, bye-bye unsaved progress!  The same thing tends to happen when I'm using the Danger Room computer, or using an Xtraction Point to change my team: the screen will go black, and I'll find myself back at the title screen.\n\nThe Hero Stash is another source of frustration.  You're allowed to keep up to 60 things in there, but I've discovered that anytime I exceeded 15, all the equipment from Beast/Forge's shop that was for sale would just vanish.  That's right; Beast/Forge would suddenly just stop selling stuff to you (except for potions and the Grab Bag), and I could not get the shop to start offering stuff again, even after I got rid of some stuff from the Hero Stash.\n\nAlso, you probably noticed that defeated enemies and breakable objects often cough up tech bits and, more rarely, armor and equipment.  I've noticed that all this stops right around the end of Chapter 2: I can't get any money (tech bits) from that point on, no matter how many enemies I beat!  How the HECK am I supposed to buy potions and armor and equipment without any money?\n\nAll these bugs have screwed up my save data permanently several times already, and I've had to start the game over from the beginning each time, hoping that I can do something differently each time to avoid the bugs, but no such luck.  Frankly, I'm now sick of trying.\n\nWhat was Raven Software doing with this game???  Did they even have a Quality Assurance department?

Jerry/Daniel (the main character has two names, and I'm still not sure exactly why) was witty and easy to like.  He always had a snappy comeback line even when things got bad.  More than once, I laughed out loud.\n\nThe main drawbacks were the editing and eBook formatting.  There were many tense, POV and overall grammatical issues.  In many cases, I found myself re-reading paragraphs to figure out whose head I was supposed to be in.  There were times were the POV was jumping from one person to the next within the same paragraph.  This along with poor formatting which broke off paragraphs mid-sentence or cut out half of a word, left me confused a lot.\n\nOverall, the storyline, although at times unorganized, was fast-paced and entertaining and the characters really kept it going.

If you want something that looks nice this is it, if you want something that will protect your phone keep looking.", "This is a product I really want to love but it has a lot of issues.  Rather than highlight its merits, I'll quickly let everyone know why I think it's a terribly executed product:\n\n1.  ***Callers hear their voice echo consistently when using this case***.  Whenever someone says they hear their voice echoing, I remove the phone from the case and they say the echo is gone.  I have no idea why this would be the case (get it?  Case?).  Anyway, this issue is not limited to the Juice Pack air.  It affects the OffGrid case as well (which I've also tried and will be switching back to).  Callers don't experience as much echo with the OffGrid case as this case, however.  With the Juice Pack Air, callers report bad echo on every single call.  I even returned my Air case and tried another one.  The replacement did the same thing.\n\n2.  You can only charge both the iPhone and the Air case when the case is in `Standby' mode.  Standby mode means you need to flick the switch on the bottom whenever you want your iPhone to be charged by the case.  It's not an automatic switchover once one of the batteries depletes.  Then, if you try to charge the case/phone when it's in `normal' mode, you'll get a message saying the phone can't be charged with this accessory so you need to be careful to switch back to Standby before recharging.  The replacement Juice Pack Air I tried does the same thing.  I could probably live with this, but I think it's a little unusual.\n\n3.  Technical support (and customer product support) acts as if they are completely unaware of the above issues.  When I reported each issue, they immediately sent me an automated e-mail asking me to mail the case back to them for a replacement, as if they didn't want to deal with troubleshooting or acknowledging the problems.\n\n4.  All of the iPhone buttons are so recessed they are difficult to reach with even skinny fingers.  If you had medium-thick fingers, it may be physically impossible to reach them when the phone is in the case.\n\n5.  The USB port is on the bottom right side which means the USB cable sticks out where your right hand would be if you wanted to send a text while it's charging.  So basically, it's very difficult to text when the phone/case is charging.\n\n6.  My first Air case did not work right out of the box.  It simply wouldn't take a charge.  Simple enough - I exchanged it for another.  Both replacements have charged fine.  So there may be a QC issue with the Air case in general.\n\nTo me, the better option is the OffGrid case.  It is thinner and doesn't suffer from echoing as much as this case.  The buttons on the OffGrid case are easily accessible.  And you don't have to worry about what position the case is in to charge both the phone and case simultaneously.  It's got a kickstand for watching videos/photos on a table.  The USB port is on the bottom which means you can charge and text at the same time.  And lastly, if you get the generic version on eBay, it's less than half the price of this case (just search for slim battery case iphone).", "Pregnancy is uncomfortable enough.

Won't stay lit to light a cigarette", "After berating the game makers for being over five months late in releasing this game and then belittling them for dropping the price to a bargain-bin amount of 20 bucks even before it hit the shelves, my pre-review for this game concluded by saying:\n\"Being such a hard-core adventure game fanatic, if and when it finally does come out, I'll gladly play it.  Like the saying goes, 'there's no such thing as bad chocolate'.  But, at this point, I'm not holding my breath for some Godiva-like quality with this one.\"\nWell, the game did finally arrive and after playing it for a couple of hours last night, I can honestly say that this game is actually like the product \"Mocklate\" in the 'Friends' episode where Monica is hired to cheerfully promote the faux-product.  It looks just like chocolate, but it leaves a really BAD taste in your mouth!\nMy wife and I really love to play adventure games, it is the only game genre we play.  If you've seen some of our other game reviews, you will know this is true.  While the initial episode of Crystal Key was inexplicably a strong seller, the game itself was not exactly earth-shattering.  We've played a lot of adventure games and 'The Crystal Key' ranks well down on our list of favorites (but, by all means, not at the bottom).  It was just a good, solid, average adventure game.  When they announced a sequel, we figured that they probably learned from the competition, grown along with the technology of gaming, and created a new chapter of the story that matches or exceeds the original.\nBoy, could that NOT be further from the truth.  This game is truly awful!  With the delays and price-chopping factored in, we had set our expectations exceedingly low.  But, some how, they managed to sink even well below that level.  The pre-released screen shots and trailer for the game cannot prepare you for how bad the actual gameplay really is.  Here are just a few of the CONs to the game (there are no PROs):\n-The graphics are even worse than the original game (which is almost five years old now).  Like the first game, they are pre-rendered, 360 degree panning shots that you are forced to navigate from point to point.  However, the textures and details of these graphics are far worse than in game one.  Every scene looks washed out and out of focus.  Plus, the cylindrical views actually \"jumped and popped\" as we turned which got exceedingly annoying after a while.\n-The music soundtrack, I am not kidding, sounds like it was dubbed from a porno movie!  I think they meant to give the game a \"hipper\" beat but, oh my, I don't think they intended to make THAT association.\n-The characters of the game are immovable, pixilated add-ins that show absolutely no emotion.  The voice-over acting is adequate, but the dialog is sophomoric at best.\nThis drivel looks like it was created by a twelve-year-old, indy game developer using an old 386 computer.  Unfortunately, the list of credits for this game includes many members of a professional creative team!  I would have been much more lenient with my review had it actually been an independent creation.  ...", "I usually go with the No Fear Shakespeare series, but made a spur-of-the-moment decision to buy this book because a printed No Fear Shakespeare Macbeth wasn't available on Prime, and this book's reviews were good.  Well, I can only guess that folks who like this book haven't seen No Fear Shakespeare.  Many of this book's \"translated\" lines are so close to the original that they don't add to your understanding of the play.  The character list is just a list of names with titles added (e.g. \"MACBETH General in the King's Army\"), not No Fear Shakespeare's extended descriptions.  It's lacking margin notes such as are included in No Fear Shakespeare.\n\nI'm giving up on this book, and will read No Fear Shakespeare Macbeth on the Spark Notes site instead, since the play is coming up and I don't have time to order another book.", "Still using it.

Billed as the conclusion of Conclave of Shadows it is terribly disappointing.

Perhaps if the Duke hadn't been such a black and white bad guy in the preceding books it might have been easier to believe his rehabilitation.  Without any hint of conscience or conflict in him before, his complete change of heart is improbable at minimum.  The conclusion is not only no conclusion at all, but the lead-in to it is too poorly developed to leave you any desire to find out what comes next, in other words, to pursue an actual conclusion to the story.\n\nThat said, his writing style is very readable and the pace was right.

So I think I'm doing a public service to alert potential buyers that this is one of the most over-rated games I've ever played.  In plain language, it's not worth the money, even if it was free.\n\nThose of us who have played Valkyrie Profile (1 or 2) will recognize that the ploy is borrowed.  This is the story of the end of the world as told in the old Norse legends.  Well, not quite as they were told.  More like what would happen if you put some scraps of Norse legend, a dash of bible, and some other random tidbits in a blender.  Think twisted fairytales without the glitter.  But the problem isn't really the story line.  I've enjoyed many games where the narrative was even more mindless.  The problem is that the gameplay is horrendous.\n\nThere are five primary characters in the game, each playing under some form of curse.  All with abusive parents, and dysfunctional enough to fill a library of self-help books.  You get to play each one, one at a time, through the same exact settings with slightly different scenarios.  There is a story section that shows how these paths interrelate, But from the player's viewpoint what you get is an unending supply of sameness.  Add in a fairly simple minded set of attacks, stiff animation and balky controls and you have a pretty clear idea of the experience.  In battle you also are likely to get hit with something out of the blue, so add arbitrary outcomes to the list.\n\nMoney is hard to find and desperately needed, since you level up by overeating.  If you ever want to be more than a complete wimp you will find yourself gathering seeds, planting them, and feeding them by killing opponents.  And you get to do this for five separate characters.  All to the sound of a minimal music track and a slew of rude noises.  Your greatest pleasure may turn out to be those accidentally humorous scenes where a character defeats a monster by repeatedly stabbing it in the crotch.\n\nAtlus usually does a better job than this.

(Altough I think this all Gilmour-Waters confrontation is dull as hell and doesn't contribute at all in any aspect...)\nIm a Pink Floyd fan. That meaning, that I truly aprecciate the band really great albums, those who were a result of a colective sound and are their best. (Excluding The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, which is a complete masterpiece, only contrasted by Sgt Peppers). Wish You Were Here is the clearest example of this, with 4 members working it off and making a true masterpiece of music...\nSo, what happened. My theory is this. (and please respect it and don't bash it if ur beliefs are different). Roger Waters has too much going on inside of him. Mother fixation, father trauma, the world unjustice factor... And in some terms that was really (or is) great. That made Roger lyrics little pieces of jewelry that we all can relate to. His composition levels were great (and are) too, and with Dave, Rick and Nick behind them, they had so much power and become floyd compositions. Tis was the floyd working at full machine. Of course the other guys have some excellent compositions too, but this was an example..\nBut beggining with Animals and finishing with this album, it seems to me that the lyrics overrun the music. That, for me has been Roger Waters problem. He let the lyrics led, forgets about musicianship at all. The oposite thing happens to David Gilmour. While he focus on the music, the lyrics are allright, but not just great.\nSo thats it here. For me, it was a Roger Waters album. Because it didn't sounded like the Floyd anymore, (there are some theories that say that there is not a PF sound...come on!, the atmospheric spacy sound, the guitar work, the lyrics...) it sounded more like an pop orchestra Roger Waters album. I personally don't like his voice, and he knew that in the late 60s and the early 70s... he let the others sing, while he made a right appearence in one or two songs...\nSo, yeah, it was a dissapointing thing for me hearing this. After  Animals (3.5) and the Wall (3), this was Floyd lowest point, and not. Because this was, and not, a Pink Floyd album.\nThe music here is good though, for an average album, but nothing more than a vehicle for the lyrics. And that's why these songs weren't on The Wall. They just not reached the standarts of the band. But Mr. Waters took over, and the rest its history.", "Falsely advertised. Product returned. Not for use when diving or swimming.

The gameplay is fluid and you definately get a good assortment of moves to dispatch your enemies with. The level progression system is definatively Diablo inspired. Now for what's wrong with the game. For starters, your max level is 9. Which for any adventure/rpg title is very disappointing on more than one count. Case in point, you cannot max out all of your stats at level 9, which means you must allocate points to only the skills you want to really beef up. Which wouldn't be terrible if A) You were actually aware that you had to do this, and B) If the game didn't force you to use all of your potential skills. So what you end up having instead of a customizable character whom you can choose to make a fighter or a spellcaster, etc. you are forced to have a little of everything, creating an overall mediocre character.

How could they not realize they were putting out such a flawed product when the original was so great? Maybe they got overconfident and stopped trying, thinking they could just ride on NWN's lapels for the rest of their careers.\n\nAnd now I just know there are some folks out there dying to tear me down to size by commenting that there are a number of fixes for this terrible framerate (since I'm far from the only person to experience it, it seems an entire small community has sprung up around attempting to fix NWN2.)\n\nLet me just head y'all off at the pass, there.

I would strongly recommend that readers avoid this novel.\n\nI skipped the fourth book in the series, \"A Feast For Crows\", because of horrific \"word-of-mouth\" feedback, and should not have invested time reading this novel either.\n\nThe first book in this series was excellent, and the second one was quite good, but each successive novel is more tedious than the prior one. Needless to say, \"A Dance with Dragons\" is the most boring novel of the series thus far.\n\nThe author continually drones on and on about inane, nonconsequential matters. He spends inordinate amounts of time describing scenery in the most minute detail, and also subjects the readers to numerous narratives that possess zero entertainment value. For example, readers should not read a single Daenerys narrative (they are the equivalent of \"watching paint dry\").\n\nAt this point, Mr. Martin is solely writing for the sake of writing. My view is that he plans to extend the serious indefinitely in order to reap as large a monetary windfall as possible.  There is a colossal difference in \"entertainment value\" between this book and the first book in the series.\n\nI gave this book 2-stars, rather than 1-star, because it is the perfect book to read prior to retiring for the evening.

After wearing the boots for a couple months, I noticed a crack starting on my left boot, in the crease where my toes bend back.

The story is somewhat faulty, but the real damper in this film is the acting, which seems flat and lifeless, adding no emotion or heart to a movie that centers around those key feelings. Another ruinous aspect is the lifestyle in which the characters reside, which is much to exorbitant and mismatched for their jobs....  Robert, a homosexual construction worker who is tired of all the sex and \"body obsession\" that comes along with his lifestyle. Now tell me something: does it not seem a little hypocritical that he complains about body obsession, yet his physique is shown in its glorious form more that its fair share throughout the movie? That's not the end of it; he is best friends with a woman named Abbie, who is a yoga instructor and runs her own classes. This role is played out by Madonna, who seems to be having a lot of trouble in deciding which of her many fake accents to use throughout the film. She never reaches the mark of mediocre acting, much less fine acting, and instead comes across as sounding consigned and drab, adding no life to her character. Even when she cries, you know she's really pushing for tears.\nThe story somewhat picks up when Abbie, upset over her recent breakup with her two-year boyfriend Kevin, and sensible Robert have one too many drinks on the night of the Fourth of July and end up making love, or having sex (we never really know how it turns out; the screen fades black). They wake the next morning, and immediately have an argument about who put the moves on who first the previous evening. This is a waste of scene, especially in the dialogue, where the wit and witticism of Everett is totally wasted of Madonna's unenthused retorts. They go on a hiatus from seeing one another, until Robert makes the ultimate sacrifice of calling her and sending her a plant (original, yet dull).\nCould the plant be symbolic of events to come? Not even close. If we haven't seen at least one metaphorical meaning yet, we're likely never to encounter one down the road. Abbie discovers that she is pregnant, but never stops to think for one second that the baby is not Robert's (ah, how easy we forget two years of sex). They both agree to give the child a happy and loving home, which will require living together. After Abbie has the baby (which uses one of the most over-used childbirth one-liners ever), the movie skips ahead seven years to the present, even though it seems like we've been in one place the whole time. We see the happy family together among friends, but be forewarned: this is the only real time they ever spend any time together. After this point, the movie spirals into a shameful third act of Robert's jealousy over Abbie's new relationship, and a custody battle that goes nowhere in terms of plot development.\nWhat makes this movie work? Nothing, if you sit down and think about it. The movie is supposed to be about family, and the values of a family that is different from you average family. How are we supposed to see how they get along in one house if the only time we get for that is in between the arguments of the adults and the beginning of the second half? Instead, we are left with nothing but a cavalcade of Abbie's relentless whining about the absence of love from her life, Robert's ongoing will to hold onto a child that is not even his own, and occasional intervals that involve a lifeless Neil Patrick Harris as Robert's friend and confidante. He does nothing for the film on any level; he is just simply thrown into the mix, along with such actors as Lynn Redgrave and Benjamin Bratt, whom we never really get to know.\nThere always seems to be a glimmer of hope on the horizon for this movie, and just when it seems like something good is going to happen, it becomes hampered by plot twists and crappy dialogue that add nothing but running time to the movie. The third act, or the courtroom battle, is the most ludicrous of these twists. The whole premise of the movie is supposed to be about best friends working things out together. So why drag us through an entire courtroom sequence that does nothing but make us lose more feeling for the characters?\nThe acting is some of the most flat and dull performances I've seen in a movie in a long time. It makes no sense that Madonna is placed in such a role; this is a huge step down from her character in \"Evita,\" and she plays out Abbie as if she knows this is true. She is never really able to show any true emotion, and while she looks like she is right at home with the role, it makes the rest of the movie suffer and dwindle. Rupert Everett is sometimes emotional and enlightening as Robert, though his wit and humor, while adding a small degree of charm, do virtually nothing to salvage it. Supporting actors are hardly worth mentioning more than they already have been, because we never really get a chance to know them, therefore, we cannot care for them at all.\nThrough the marketing criteria, the movie is made to seem like something so much more than it really is. But, although it looks good on the outside, \"The Next Best Thing\" is a grab bag of leftover plotlines and flimsy dialogue all thrown together to create something that really doesn't have as great an impact as it aspires to have.", "It's too small to get a decent sample size.

There are other attachments you can buy for about $150 each.  Just too expensive all around.\n\nPros:  simple to use.  the device fits well in the hand. Portable.  Rechargeable.  the charge lasts a long time --- weeks.  i had occasion to call Nuface customer service, and they were very nice and helpful. You get to speak with a human.\n\nNotes:  Forget spending money on gel.  The salesman told me that I can use plain water without the gel.  I use just water and it works -- no need for any gel.\n\nUpdate:  I have been using this daily for about 10 months... I don't think my face looks different but feels different -- maybe harder/firmer? If I stop using it for just a few days, I lose that hard feeling.  Still takes about 20 mins to do the routine. Kind of time consuming, but you can do it while watching TV, reading etc..\n\nSo far, nobody has told me they notice anything different.  I look in the mirror and don't see any difference.... so, I don't think I would tell anyone to go out and buy this $$$ gadget.....

The whole game is a bit of a mish mash of CGI footage and actual movie footage which really makes the game feel like it is cut and pasted.\nThe CGI is pretty good though a bit foggy looking like the beginning of Resident Evil Remake for Nintendo ( meaning there is a slight blur to it all). The movie scenes are good but just seemed un-nesccary and really didn't add anything to the game (if i wanted to see the film id get that).\nThe controls are relatively easy and don't take much time to pick up. Probabely because you will be doing the same thing over and over again. The AI in the game respawn in certain areas and you will be contiunally shooting those damn flying machines forever thinking \" im getting bored of this\". The developers just throws AI at you with the occasional mission directive (like find Sarah Connors coffin)and think they have this new sensational game. No they don't !!!!!!\nDon't be fooled either by there campaign that they have the REAL man himself and that this makes the game better than any other. Arnold really doesn't have alot to do with this game. Basically all Arnold had to do for this game was go in a sound booth for a minute say 10 words like \" excellent\" \" reloaded\" and so forth and here we have the result. A game that really is repeative in every way and has no real distinction over other Terminators games for having the big fella involved.\nThe environments are mostly from the future setting with black charcol skys and burnt building and out of 22 levels about 18 of these are all like this. Boring, Dull and just too similar for anyone to care.\nAnd this whole first person shooter cross bred with fist fighting ????? Yer, it works and i didn't mind the bouts with the T-X. I even get the lack of fluidity with the controls as these are machines fighting not kung-fu max payne rip offs. But still, it nuthin revoultionary or really adds a great deal for the game play. Though this was my favourite part of the game and trust me thats not saying much.\nI played the whole thing through even though i got bored after the first 4 levels. The whole thing is a un-insipring mess that is not the NEXT big thing in gaming nor a decent add on to the Terminator mythos.\nConclusion: A big commerical mess that does not deliver on any of it's promises. RENT DONT BUY - even if your a fan !!!!", "Full disclosure, I am not a long time Mega Man fan, I've always wanted to check out the series since I never played them as a kid. With the mediocre reviews of the Mega Man Legacy Collection on PC, I decided that this PS2 collection must be the way to go. The first thing I noticed when starting up the first Mega Man was the harsh, bold colors. It made it difficult to even look at the screen without hurting my eyes. Second, I noticed input lag; the first boss I decided to fight was Iceman. Iceman's level involves a lot of slick surfaces so Mega Man slides around. The input delay made it extremely difficult to properly navigate through the platforming sections, and I just turned it off. I returned the game the following day, as well as the Mega Man X Collection (I didn't even bother opening it).\n\nI subsequently bought the Wii Virtual Console version of Mega Man. This is presumably a more accurate preservation of Mega Man as the colors are true to its 8-bit roots (no harsh colors), and the input lag is gone.\n\nIf you have a Wii or Wii U and don't mind coughing up the dough (this PS2 collection is a great bargain), I highly recommend buying the Mega Man games on Virtual Console.\n\nEdit: After reading the other Amazon reviews and watching a couple of Youtube reviews, I am genuinely surprised that nobody else seems to be acknowledging these issues.", "Pretty much a rubber dingy that loses its air after a few months.

Of course there is the  angst ridden company CO and the cowardly platoon commander.  The treatment  of the Germans in the film is deplorable and in fact there are only handful  of shots featuring German infantry.  As far as simulating the actual  battle, this film is a stinker.  The Americans bunch up in attack like on a  Sunday stroll and the Germans are able to foil an entire battalion attack  with a single 88mm gun with no infantry support!

Once I heard Yelawolf's album last year I told everyone the Slaughterhouse album would be just as messed up as \"Radioactive\" was, and I was right. This is not the same Slaughterhouse we heard three years ago. I guess I can start with the petty things like the cover art. It looks like a stoned toddler went and had fun on Photoshop for the first time. That cover is awful. Ok, time for the music.\n\nWhen \"The Slaughter\" starts it gets you real hyped. By the time it ends you expect the next song to come and hit hard, but it doesn't. It's some wannabe introspective track, and Royce couldn't even get through the first verse on the album without mentioning Eminem. It disgusts me. I had the same issue with their mixtape \"On The House.\" They can't stop themselves from bringing this dude's name up as much as possible. The man is washed up, stop acting like he's still on top.\n\nThroughout the album it's one song after the next and they all feel lifeless. Each one feels longer than the one before it, and it's just boring. It's obvious they tried to take the commercial route with songs like \"Throw That,\" \"My Life,\" \"Throw It Away\" & \"Park It Sideways.\" Those are hands down the worst songs on the album. There are some songs like \"Rescue Me\" that could have been dope, but it wasn't necessary to have all four of them spit a verse. That song would've been fantastic with just Crooked I and Joe Budden because they both spit amazing verses.\n\nOverall Joell Ortiz surprised me the most. Lately it's felt like his heart wasn't fully in it, but a good chunk of his verses on here aren't bad. Royce had to be the most annoying. And I hate to say something like that because I love Royce, but he just sounds so full of himself now. Crooked I did what Crooked I does best and was definitely the most consistent with his verses. Joe Budden's presence felt almost nonexistent and the verses he did drop were very bland.\n\nThe guest artists weren't anything special either. On the main album Eminem appears on two songs and appears on one of the bonus cuts. Skylar Grey appears on two songs and Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz, and Cee Lo Green each make an appearance. Luckily most of the guests only provided hook support except Em on track two and B.o. B on one of the bonus songs.\n\nAs far as the bonus tracks go they really don't lend anything to the main album. All they really do is drag the album on longer. They could have stopped the album after \"Goodbye\" and it probably would've been fine. \"Asylum\" has a really dope concept and the verses are pretty dope, but they all did a whisper flow which brought it down. For the most part the production is nice, but there were some beats that were really annoying.\n\nStandout Songs: \"Hammer Dance,\" \"Flip A Bird\" & \"Goodbye\"\n\nOverall Score: 4/10 - This is disappointing. Even though I was expecting this to happen, I didn't want to believe it. I used to run around screaming \"SLLLLAAAAAUUUGHTERHOUSSSEEE!\" but I guess that's over now. Hopefully they get their act together on the next album.

Many of the other tunes featured this kind of unnecessary twiddling:  \"Detroit Rock City,\" \"Calling Dr. Love\" and \"Black Diamond\" among them.  Then there's the inevitable problem of trying to get the non-Ezrin produced stuff to sound right with the Destroyer material.  Ezrin always recorded all his effects right onto the master tape, so making his stuff match the Kerner/Wise and Kramer material is only mildly successful.  Again:  if you ONLY like the original quartet, go ahead with Double Platinum.  If you want a wider range of years, without the odd remixed tunes, better go with the newest hits package, or splurge on the Box Set.", "for earth day, i celebrated by . . going to my local deli, purchasing as many sandwiches as possible, throwing them all in the trash, then taking those styrofoam boxes and digging them deep in the earth in various ity parks. it was awesome. i felt good afterward because i knew i had done my part that day!! also took all the non-biodegradable trash from my garbage and strewn it around as many school gardens as i could find.it truly was a WONDERFUL earth day!! yay!!!!", "I did not like this product.

Although  Trump  has promoted the Jerusalem move as fulfilling a key campaign promise   he  also was outspoken last month in blasting the $1 billion price tag for a new embassy in London.\nSince  Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  announcement   his  administration has been sifting through options for fast-tracking the Israel embassy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relocation. Last month  Vice President Mike Pence announced during a visit to Israel that the embassy would move by the end of 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 possibly earlier. Ambassador David Friedman  who lobbied for  Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital  has advocated moving the embassy as soon as possible.\nsee also  Trump  tells Palestinian leader US embassy will move to  Jerusalem President Trump  told Middle East leaders Tuesday that  he  plans...\n Adelson  who donated $5 million to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inaugural committee   is one of the Republican Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest donors and a major supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Adelson  also finances Israel Hayom  a pro-Netanyahu newspaper that is distributed free throughout Israel.\nIf lawyers decide to allow donations for the Jerusalem embassy  it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be without significant political risk for  Trump .  The president  already faces major criticism from Palestinians and others who say  his  decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also claimed by the Palestinians for the capital of their future state \u00e2\u0080\u0094 tipped the scaled unfairly in Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor.\nMort Klein  president of the pro-Israel group Zionist Organization of America and a close associate of  Adelson   said accepting donations would be ill-advised. Klein said he knew  Adelson  was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeeply interested\u00e2\u0080\u009d in seeing the embassy relocate to Jerusalem but was unaware that the casino mogul had offered to help pay for it himself.", "didnt like", "They really do all seem really close in flavor...", "Say this for the soundtrack, it drowns out the lousy dialogue.", "This book did not live up to my expectations of an Irish gem. In fact, just a few days after finishing it, I find it hard to recall details.\n\nThe writing was gorgeous and brilliant. But unfortunately, the plot and characters were very dark, so I felt dragged down and depressed while reading this book. I got confused when the plot jumped all over the place, from past to present. The characters all resent each other bitterly, revealing little affection or hopefulness. Reading this during winter in Seattle was just too dreary."]}}
